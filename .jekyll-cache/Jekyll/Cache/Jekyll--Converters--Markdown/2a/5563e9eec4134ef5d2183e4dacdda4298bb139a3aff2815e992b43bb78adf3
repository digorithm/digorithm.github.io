I"r<p>One of the most common kind of applications in today's tech/business world is the CRUD system, that is the idea of the user interacting with a database, so the user can Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete <em>(yep, that awful name came from this)</em> data from this database. Also, <strong>learning how to create a CRUD with a language is a great way to understand the basics of this language, the basics of software design, engineering and architecture.</strong> In layman's term, a CRUD page is just a page where you can insert a thing, edit that thing, search that thing and delete that thing, just that!</p>
