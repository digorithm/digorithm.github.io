I"‹<p>Iâ€™ve been working with AI/Machine Learning at <a href="http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/">Jusbrasil</a> recently, and itâ€™s being pretty challenging due to the <em>huge</em> amount of data that we have to deal with, so cleaning this data and making predictions and classifications in an acceptable time demands a nice AI architecture.</p>

<p>That said I can say that Iâ€™m extremely thankful for a few technologies that are helping me go through this challenge <em>(and the pain of cleaning this amount of data)</em>: Python, Scikit Learn, Pandas, and the whole stack that the Scikit Learn use, such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and few others.</p>
