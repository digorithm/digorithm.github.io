I"{<p>Well, this case was a fun one, sentiment analysis is a sub type of NLP <em>(natural language processing)</em> in which you have to train a model to analyze a text, and classify it was a negative sentiment or a positive sentiment. In this case, I wanted to apply it on movies reviews, to see if a review is a negative one or a positive one. So, basically, teaching this kind of sentiment to the machine.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of challenges in doing this kind of NLP, experience has told me that when the text is big, it is usually hard to predict things about it… and most of the times, movie reviews are big chunk of text.</p>
