I"¸<p>Iâ€™ve been reading many texts on automata theory these times, and let me tell you, thatâ€™s such a wonderful thing. It pretty much explain how computers canâ€¦. compute! Simply put, Automata Theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as Automata.</p>

<p>From the mathematical models to represent it to the fun programming implementations, itâ€™s really great and exciting to study it!</p>
