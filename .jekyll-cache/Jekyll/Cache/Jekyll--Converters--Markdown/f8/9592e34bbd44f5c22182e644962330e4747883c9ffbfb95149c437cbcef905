I"¡<p>I'm <strong>Rodrigo Ara√∫jo</strong>. I live in Vancouver, Canada, though originally from Brazil. I'm a software engineer with a background in Computer Science. 
    I build software and do research to help humans achieve greater things.</p>

<p>
The first job I fell in love with was working as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.jusbrasil.com.br">Jusbrasil</a> -- 
<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/fr/top-websites/category/law-and-government/legal">the biggest law and government websites in the world</a> at the time of this writing. 
It was the first time I felt that the code I wrote directly impacted millions of people.
</p>

<p>Then, I decided to go to grad school at the beautiful University of British Columbia, 
    where I was part of the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/software-practices-lab">Software Practices Lab</a> 
    working as a research software engineer on using machine learning to build reliable self-adaptive distributed systems 
    (<a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0379346">here's my published thesis</a>). 
    Also around that time I worked as a teaching assistant helping hundreds of students to build better software, where I
    discovered an unexpected passion for mentoring and teaching. 
</p>

<p>
    I had a great time in academia, but I felt I needed to go back to that feeling of building things that have a direct
    positive impact on people. So I took a senior engineer / tech lead position at  <a href="http://cto.ai/">CTO.ai</a>,
    building products, data pipelines, and distributed systems that handled copious amounts of data.
</p>

<p>
    Now I'm at <a href="https://www.cmd.com">Cmd</a>, building secure distributed systems in the cybersecurity space.

<h1>Research and work</h1>

<p><em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">Software</a> <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">is</a> <a href="">eating</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/04/11/why-software-is-eating-the-world/#31314bde29a2">the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/software-is-eating-the-world-5-years-later/">world</a></em> and yet, it's amazing how unreliable and internally broken most software and software practices are. This is mostly due the fact that we are a young field taking its first baby steps, and this is quite exciting. I believe it is our job, as a community, to slowly but steadily improve the way we build software. Thus, one of my personal missions is to <strong>make software more reliable and correct; by both improving software and improving how we build software.</strong></p>
