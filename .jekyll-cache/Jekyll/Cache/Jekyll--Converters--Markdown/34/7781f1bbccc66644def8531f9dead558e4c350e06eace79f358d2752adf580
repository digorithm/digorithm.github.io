I"R<p>Artificial Neurons is one of the most beautiful ways to simulate a biological behavior through computation, despite the fact that itâ€™s not very close to the level of details of a real neuron. But it captured the core of what a neuron is doing.</p>

<p>And I find that trying to understand this mathematical method by first understanding the concept through a metaphor <em>(which, in this case, I think that the metaphor is our mathematical side, and not the biological one, the biological is just, you know, the real thing)</em> is really valuable to gain an intuition on this topic.</p>
