I"b<p>The first thought I had when I started to study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Design Patterns</a> was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>- “damn, is all this really necessary?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, so many patterns, so many details to do things that look simple to do without any further detailed thoughts. And I started to question myself if this was really a productive thing. The first answer I gave was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>-”no, *wonderful not-bad-word* this, I’m losing too much time trying to wrap my head around this”</em></p>
</blockquote>
