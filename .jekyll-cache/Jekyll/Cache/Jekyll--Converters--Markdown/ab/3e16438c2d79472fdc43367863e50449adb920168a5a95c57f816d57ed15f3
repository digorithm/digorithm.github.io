I"ª<p>The more I think about the advantages and disadvantages of upfront design, the more I find it complex, I mean, the whole software architecture diagramming in general. Iâ€™ve been following the development of the <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2014/08/24/c4_model_poster.html">C4 model</a> for a considerable time, I find it interesting, but it still brings me the old struggles about how much detail we should put into the diagrams and whether we should do it while planning the software, while developing it, or after.</p>

<p>I believe that when drawing architecture diagrams we should focus on getting the right purpose and the right level of abstraction.</p>
