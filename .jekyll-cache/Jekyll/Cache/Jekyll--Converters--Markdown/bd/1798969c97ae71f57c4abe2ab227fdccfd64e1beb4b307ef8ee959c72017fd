I"\<p>Graph Theory is definitely one of my favorite branches of the Mathematics &amp; Computer Science, mostly because of its nearest infinity applications, in both real world problems and pure theoretical problems.</p>

<p>These days I’ve been working (with my buddy Daniel Almeida) in a framework to create and manipulate graphs. Which means, creating a data structure to represent graphs, edges, vertexes and creating algorithms to work on this structure. All this is being made with Java and I’ll expose this code here, as I saw a terrible lack of good readable codes about it on the internet.</p>
