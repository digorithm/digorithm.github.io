<p>
<strong>Before we start, which are the main goals of the object-oriented programming?</strong></p>

<p><em>1. Abstraction, yes, i had to put this in the first place, in my point of view, this is the biggest goal of the OO programming</em></p>

<p>2. Encapsulation, which is a form of abstraction!</p>

<p>3. Reusability</p>

<p>4. Modularity</p>

<p>5. Readability</p>

<p>Let’s say that OO programming did <strong>never</strong> exist, so, i can say that any procedural programmer <em>(C, fortran, cobol, etc..)</em> who has a little notion about how to build organized codes, would, naturally, evolve to an organization that would look like the actual concept of OO programming.</p>

<p>Don’t you think? It would be intuitive, the object-oriented thinking is a quite natural way to think, let me show you… We are used to separate <em>things</em> (from now we’ll call thing as objects) by it’s <em>class</em>, just like the class “Car”, we know GM, wolksvagem, nissan, honda…but they all are cars, right? And we’re also used to say that something <em>inherited</em> some particularities from his precedent… And that’s the idea behind the OO programming, grab the main concept of object and class that defines objects in <strong>real world</strong> and use it on programming!</p>

<img src="/images/dog.gif">
<p>

Just before the creation of Object-Oriented Programming, the system development in C was using the concept of breaking the big problem into small sub-problems, where each sub-result together would generate the solution of the big problem in question. It’s actually smart to think like this, the OOP languages just formalized this concept (and of course, create others features, but this was the start point). Look at this following problem: We want a data structure to represent the functionaries of determined business, this functionary should have a name, age, salary and a function to change his salary. Let’s deal with it in the smartest way, which is, creating separately some structure that will represent the functionaries, in C we would code something like this:
</p>



<pre>
<code class="c hljs">
typedef struct functionary{
  int age;
  char name[50];
  float salary;
}stru_func, *ap_func;

void riseSalary(ap_func pthis){ 
      int n;
      printf("Enter new salary: \n");
      scanf("%d", n);
      pthis->salary = n;
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>As you can see, in this func.c, we have the structure to represent the functionaries and the function that we will use. (from now, we’ll call function as METHODS)</p>

<p>And here’s the <strong>main code:</strong></p>

<pre>
<code class="c hljs">
#include "func.c"
int main(){
  stru_func new;
  printf("Enter the age, name and salary: \n");
  scanf("%d", &amp;new.age);
  scanf("%s", &amp;new.name);
  scanf("%f", &amp;new.salary);
  printf ("%d \n", new.age);
  printf ("%s \n", new.name);
  printf ("%f \n", new.salary);
  riseSalary(&amp;new);
  printf("%f", new.salary);
  return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Done, now we have a nice example of class and object…but, made with C! Where the class is this struct called “functionary” and the variables inside it we call “attributes” and the function “riseSalary” we call “method” (obs: look that the function/method is OUTSIDE the struct functionary), in fact we separate the module that represent the functionaries from the main module, and if we want, we can use this functionary module in other problems that need a struct to represent functionaries with those attributes/methods!</p>

<p>And…where’s the object? Right there in the main module, where we created a “variable” called “new” from the struct functionary, this is called “INSTANCE”, in this moment, we create a object from its class! Again, the class is the structure that represent the functionary and the object is the “variable” that we created with this structure!</p>

<p>All these concepts already happened before the creation of the pure Object-Oriented languages, but there was a need of formalize these techniques, creating more rigorous, useful and trustful standards.</p>

<p>The same problem that we solved in C, in java, would be something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
public class functionary
{
  public int age;
  public string name;
  public int salary;
  public void riseSalary(int n)
  {
      this.salary = n;
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>As you should have noticed, the method now is INSIDE the structure that represent the functionary (the class).
And what the big advantage of this? the class is now more portable, we can reuse it easily!</p>
<p>in the main module we could just create as many object as we want just using:
<em>“functionary func = new functionary();”</em></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Of course that the big evolution of procedural to Object-Oriented did not stop there! The concept of reuse, organize and divide the code and the problem created others many famous techniques that we can use on classes and objects, like the <strong>polymorfism</strong>, inheritance, abstract class and many others! But this evolution kept one main goal: <strong>modularity with more abstraction.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong> </strong>Or How Diving Into a Large Code Base Can Be Just Like Reading a Book With Unnumbered and Scrambled Pages.</em><p>-->
<p>Well, it all will start with your first steps on studying programming, a very innocent and and naive programming, i mean, your very first “Hello World” and the classics “Read 3 inputs and print the sum of them”, where your concerns will happen because of some missing commas, whitespaces and some misplaced IF’s… things that at first sight may cause a little confusion, you’ll start to think that’s even something hard.</p>

<pre>
<code class="c hljs">
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
printf("Hello World");
return (0);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The time will pass, you’ll start to understand logic better, and get impressed with your first program written with 150 lines of pure java code, and this will be you amazed about it</p>

<p align="center"><img class="" title="image" src="/images/amazed.png" alt="images" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Now you’ve become a programmer, or even better, a <em>software engineer</em>, right?!
we shall answer that soon, let’s continue our timeline…</strong></h3>

<p>You’ll commit yourself to do your first not-so-trivial software project, maybe a stock management system, using some sort of web technology and data persistence with some cool database system. After a few days and some effort, you’ll finish your project and get even more amazed…1500 lines of code!!</p>

<p>Until happen the first problem with your system and you gotta fix it, and you will have to come back to it after 1 month without looking at its code and your first reaction, probably, will be this:</p>

<p align="middle"><img class="" title="image" src="/images/scared.jpeg" alt="images" width="400" height="250" /></p>
<p>
And you start to suspect <em>“Well…maybe i’m not this Software Engineer thing yet”</em></p>

<p>From this point, you start to study some software development principles, design patterns and how to write reusable and maintainable code and all this stuff. Uff…finally, now you’ll think <em>“i feel more professional now”</em> and that finally you can deal with the industrial world, so you’ll come to a important step:<p>

<h3><strong>“it’s time to get a software engineering internship”</strong></h3>

<p>Well, I will tell you the consequences from this important decision in 3 phases:</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Phase 1 — New technologies to study</h3>
<p>After a short search for a internship opportunity, a software company finally will hire you as an intern, and you, with all your experience dealing with code bases that you created by yourself <em>(getting the mark of even 2 thousand lines of code, wow!)</em> will <em>think</em> that you’re prepared… So your manager says some new stuff to study, so you can understand the technologies of the company: J2EE, JPA, Hibernate, JSF, HTTP, FTP, JavaScript, Jquery, AJAX among others, well, you’ll be a little shocked at first, that’s normal, but anyway, you, <strong>strong programmer</strong>, affirms <em>“it’s okay, i can learn it quickly”</em></p>

<p>what bring us to the big shock that is the phase 2…</p>
&nbsp;

<h3>Phase 2— The company show to you their legacy systems</h3>
<p>Ok, then you studied every concept that were indicated to you to learn on <strong>phase 1</strong>, so, you, with all experience that you have <em>(because you wrote 2 thousand lines of code, right?)</em>, affirms <em>“ I’m ready to work with the company’s systems ”</em>, then, your manager shows to you their system that was written in java, <strong><em>10 years ago, with a total of 700 thousand lines of code without documentation</em></strong> and he says:</p>

<p><em>— “You will be responsible by the maintenance of this system, here’s the code, study it, good luck!”</em></p>

<p>And you, <em>programmer</em>, looks to the code, runs the system, looks to the code again…and your <em>only</em> reaction is:</p>

<p align="middle"><img class="" title="image" src="/images/depressive.png" alt="images" width="400" height="300" />

<p>And this is the time that you’ll start to doubt about the universe’s laws. You’ll start to think that nothing makes sense anymore and all your knowledge was a lie…after all…</p>

<p><em>“seriously, what the fuck is this? there’s no way to understand this code, it’s giant, messy, old and nothing makes sense” </em>— you think.</p>

<p align="middle"><img class="" title="image" src="/images/matrix.gif" alt="This is what the code looks like to you" width="500" height="350" /></p>

<p>And then, the desperation takes over your thoughts, you realize that everything you learnt on your classes and on <em>codecademy</em> was very different of the real world systems, you don’t know where to start…but after read the code 10000000 times…you, in a <strong>magic</strong> way, gets to the <strong>phase 3</strong>.</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Phase 3— The discovery</h3>
<p>After much effort and lost nights, you, magically, starts to see patterns in these many lines of code, you start to see a logical flow and the most important thing:</p>
<h3>You start to realize that even a uncommented code has the power to tell you a story</h3>
<p><em>“A story? how is that possible?”</em></p>

<p>Exactly, the more time you spent there trying to understand the code, more you started to see <strong>patterns</strong>, it’s like the code could talk by itself, telling what problems they were trying to solve, it’s like you were present at that time when the old engineers were doing a <em>brainstorm</em> to find the solution to certain problem</p>

<p>And you, young future engineer, start to see the logical flow inside those 700 thousand lines of code, and strange as it may sound, you start to mentally talk with the code, and the most amazing, the code starts to answer to you, and it gives you tips and paths to follow so you can understand it better.</p>

<p>And suddenly you reached a state of mental ecstasy, so all your powers got back to your hands and all this messy and dirty code starts to make sense and gain shape:</p>

<p align="middle"><img class="" title="image" src="/images/matrix2.jpeg" alt="images" width="500" height="350" /></p>

<p>And then, the following quote from <em>Eric Filson</em> makes a huge sense in your life:</p>
<h3><em>“The art of programming is finding patterns where others see only chaos”</em></h3>
<p>
Yes, this is where you really start your love story with the art of software writing, is where you create your extreme connection between your mind and the code, is where you, temporarily, disconnect from the real world and connect yourself to new others universes: <strong>Your systems</strong>.</p>

<p>Where new laws are created and you understand all of them, yes, all of them. Universes which you have total control and you like it. At this moment is created an emotional bond between you and the system, you created it, you own your own universe, use it with responsability, after all, thousand people depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>No matter what happen, don’t give up to understand the logical flow of your new universe, the key to this comprehension is to stay mentally connected to the system, feel it, live it, walk inside it just like the processor, step by step, line by line, command by command, trust me</strong></p>
<h2><strong>You will find the pattern inside the chaos.</strong></h2>
