  <div>
    
    <p>I’ve been reading many texts on automata theory these times, and let me tell you, that’s such a wonderful thing. It pretty much explain how computers can…. compute! Simply put, Automata Theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as Automata.</p>

<p>From the mathematical models to represent it to the fun programming implementations, it’s really great and exciting to study it!</p>

<p>Automatons are abstract models of machines that perform computations on an input by moving through a series of states or configurations. At each state of the computation, a transition function determines the next configuration on the basis of a finite portion of the present configuration. As a result, once the computation reaches an accepting configuration, it accepts that input. The most general and powerful automata is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>.</p>

<p>In layman’s terms, FSM <em>(Finite State Machine)</em> or Automaton is a device <em>(hardware or software)</em> that responds to external events and produces actions. The actions generated depend on the past history of the system, i.e. its state.</p>

<p>This can go from a simple reserved word analyzer</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/thenautomata2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To big Regular Expressions:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/bigdfa.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Automatons are also essentials to understand the <strong>limits of the computation</strong>, thus, we have now two important problems coming out from this thought:</p>

<p>1. What computers can do?</p>

<p>2. What computers can do efficiently?</p>

<p>The first one is called <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse322/08sp/lec20.pdf">Decidability</a> and the second one is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability">intractability</a></p>

<p>And it brings our minds to the very beginning of the Computing Science, where many scientist were thinking about the limits of computation, not that today there aren’t many scientists working on it, but today many programmers, sadly, ignore this kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>But, returning to our automatons, they’re represented by a bunch of states that we represent formally as \( Q \), a finite set of symbols ( \( \sum \) ), a transition function ( \( \delta \) ) that has two parameters: a state \( Q \) and a symbol, this function is responsible for the change of states in the automaton. An initial State from \( Q \) and a acceptance state also from \( Q \).</p>

<p>So we can say that a generic automaton can be represented formally as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
A = \left ( Q, \sum, \delta, q0, F \right ) 
</script>

<p>The automatons fall into two classifications, they can be:</p>

<h2 id="deterministic">Deterministic</h2>

<p>Where they can’t be at more than one state at the same time, it’s the real world way to represent abstracts machines, because this kind of automaton has no ambiguity . Here’s a simple example of an DFA <em>(Deterministic Finite Automaton)</em> that only accepts string having 001 as substring.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/dfaex1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Informally speaking, if you put a string of 0s and 1s such as 10011 and process it number by number, following the states changes you will see that it will end the processing and your current state will be the acceptance state, so, this string is acceptable! So a string such as 11101010, if you try the same process, won’t end at an acceptable state, so we say that this string is not acceptable by this automaton.</p>

<h2 id="non-deterministic">Non Deterministic</h2>

<p>In this case, the automaton can change to multiple states at the same time, which means, it’s not so deterministic and precise as the deterministic automaton. So why one would use this non deterministic automaton? Simply put, it’s way easier to design a NFA (Non deterministic Finite Automaton) to solve a determined problem than to design a precise DFA to solve this same problem.</p>

<p><strong>But! We’ve a problem here!</strong></p>

<p><em>How can a computer, which is an unambiguous machine, process something that is not deterministic?</em></p>

<p><strong>It can’t. And it won’t!</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/pergunta.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>So why in the seven hells would i want to use this NFA if the machine can’t understand?</em></p>

<p>The answer is, every NFA has an equivalent DFA, which means, if a language is recognized by the NFA and by the DFA, they’re equivalent. All you have to do is <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/LexicalPart3.pdf">translate</a> the NFA into a DFA so the machine can use it!</p>

<h3 id="talking-about-language-what-is-it-in-this-context">Talking about Language, what is it in this context?</h3>

<p>Well, this is what we call <strong>Regular Language</strong> which is a Language L accepted by an Automaton, <strong>so the language of an Automaton is the set of all string that it accepts.</strong></p>

<p>We can define the language of a DFA as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 
L(A) = \{ \omega \,|\, \delta(q0, \omega)\, is\, in\, F \}
</script>

<p>Which means, an Automaton processing a string, from its initial state, being computed by its transition function, if the processing ends in the acceptance state, this means that this is the language of this DFA.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-next-steps-and-further-readings">Conclusion, next steps and further readings</h2>

<p>As you may have noticed, there are unimaginable ways to use Automatons, it wasn’t even created to apply directly in the Computer Science, two neurophysiologists, were the first to present a description of finite Automata in 1943. Their paper, entitled, “A Logical Calculus Immanent in Nervous Activity”, had a huge impact in the computer science.</p>

<p>For anyone who’s trying to dive deeper in this field, I strongly advice the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Languages-Computation-Edition/dp/0321455363">Ullman’s book on Automata and Complexity Theory</a></p>

<p>And soon I pretend to write few more thing on Automata, such as techniques to translate a NFA to a DFA using the algorithm of subset construction.</p>

<p>For now my main goal was to simply introduce this beautiful branch of the Computer Science and Mathematics and show its applications.</p>

<p>If something isn’t clear to you, drop me an email and let’s talk about it! :)</p>

    <p>Graph Theory is definitely one of my favorite branches of the Mathematics &amp; Computer Science, mostly because of its nearest infinity applications, in both real world problems and pure theoretical problems.</p>

<p>These days I’ve been working (with my buddy Daniel Almeida) in a framework to create and manipulate graphs. Which means, creating a data structure to represent graphs, edges, vertexes and creating algorithms to work on this structure. All this is being made with Java and I’ll expose this code here, as I saw a terrible lack of good readable codes about it on the internet.</p>

<p>So, before we start coding the graph’s structure… we must clarify what a graph is and why it’s so important to the Computer Science (and many other sciences).</p>

<p>A graph is a ordered pair (G = (V,E)) , where (V) is a set of Vertices/Nodes and (E) is a set of Edges, an extremely mple example of a complete <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SimpleGraph.html">simple</a>, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedGraph.html">connected</a> and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html">complete</a> graph is:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/graph1.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<p><em>So, what’s the huge deal with this graph theory thing?</em></p>

<p>Well, not only theoretical computer science problems lay on the graph theory but also in many other distinct fields, from particle physics, chemistry to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_sociology">sociology</a>.</p>

<p>All this because every little thing in our universe is linked, and when this set of things became a “web of things”, we need to study its properties. And that’s where graph theory get in.</p>

<p>So when a graph gets bigger, we need to represent this structure in a computational way, so we can compute things like shortest path between two nodes, connectivity and thousand of other properties and techniques.</p>

<p>The most common ways to represent graph mathematically are:</p>

<h2 id="adjacency-matrix">Adjacency Matrix</h2>

<p>It’s a matrix that represent the adjacency of every node in a graph, it’s an excellent way to work computationally with graphs. The same graph that I presented previously in a visual way can be represented by the following adjacency matrix:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 \\\ 
1 & 0 & 1 \\\ 
1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]></script>

<h2 id="adjacency-list">Adjacency List</h2>

<p>This is another common way to represent graph mathematically, it’s a simple list of lists, each node in the main list points to a list of their adjacent nodes.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/graph2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/adjaceny-list.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="data-structures-to-represent-graphs">Data Structures to represent Graphs</h2>

<p>Ok, so, how do we represent graphs, edges and vertexes in terms of data structures? Before we dig deeper in the algorithms and the mathematical properties of the graphs, we need to create our Data Structure to work with.</p>

<h3 id="the-vertex">The vertex</h3>
<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
package GraphModels;

public class Vertex {
    /* This Data Structure will be capable to represent a Vertex,
    * which is a Node that will be used on a graph
    */
    
    public String id;
    public String name;
    public boolean visited = false;
    
    public Vertex(String id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return name;
  }
    
}

</code>
</pre>

<p>For now you may be asking yourself why do we need a variable called “Visited”. Well, we’ll be using it in algorithms to walk through the graph, so we must need to know which nodes were visited. It will became more clear soon!</p>

<h3 id="the-edge">The Edge</h3>

<p>Yes, the edge must be represented computationally! That’s our way to figure out paths through the vertexes, the edge may or may not have a weight, the edge must know its source vertex and its destination vertex</p>
<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    package GraphModels;

    public class Edge {

         /* This Data Structure will be capable to represent a Edge,
        *    that will be used on a graph
        */

        public String id;
        public Vertex source;
        public Vertex destination;
        private final int weight;

        public Edge(String id, Vertex source, Vertex destination, int weight) {
            this.id = id;
            this.source = source;
            this.destination = destination;
            this.weight = weight;
        }

        public String getId() {
            return id;
        }
        public Vertex getDestination() {
            return destination;
        }

        public Vertex getSource() {
            return source;
        }
        public int getWeight() {
            return weight;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return source + " " + destination;
        }
    } 
</code>
</pre>

<h3 id="the-graph">The Graph</h3>

<p>That’s for sure the biggest and most complex part, don’t panic with the many algorithms already implemented in this code. I’ll be explaining one by one.</p>

<p>We’re reading a text file containing the text file, if you want to test by yourself, make sure to create a .txt in the correct way and to pass the correct file path! You can find the instructions to write the .txt graph in the comments of this code</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-next-steps">Conclusion and next steps</h2>

<p>At this moment, you’re perfectly able to create a graph (via .txt file) and run all those algorithms to extract information about your graph. Just make sure to import the right libraries and to put the files in the right package. Doing these little things right, I’m pretty sure this will work perfectly.</p>

<p>But I’m sure you may be a little lost about a few algorithms and techniques we’ve implemented in the Graph.java. But, don’t worry, i’ll be explaining each method one by one in the next parts of this post!</p>

    <a href="/post/crud-with-java-jsp">CRUD with Java, JSP and MySQL</a>
  </h2>

  <div class="post-date" style="margin-bottom:15px; margin-top:-15px;">
    
    July
    22nd,
    
    2014
  </div>


  <div>
    
    <p>One of the most common kind of applications in today's tech/business world is the CRUD system, that is the idea of the user interacting with a database, so the user can Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete <em>(yep, that awful name came from this)</em> data from this database. Also, <strong>learning how to create a CRUD with a language is a great way to understand the basics of this language, the basics of software design, engineering and architecture.</strong> In layman's term, a CRUD page is just a page where you can insert a thing, edit that thing, search that thing and delete that thing, just that!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our goal</h3>
<p>Well, our scenario will be the simplest possible, so we can understand how to communicate with our database, so, it will be a simple contact book web app where we can do our CRUD with persons. This person will have <!--more--> a name, a phone number and a profession. We'll have a button to add a new person, a form to enter this new person's information, a page where will be loaded all persons from the database and buttons to edit and remove each person</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/smallcrudscreen-1024x300.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<p> 
 </p>
<h3>Our Technology Stack</h3>
<p>We'll be using Java as our backend technology, Java ServerPages(JSP) as our view technology and MySQL as our relational database. Also, we'll be using the MVC architecture, which is the idea of separating the code by <em><strong>M</strong>odel</em>, <em><strong>V</strong>iew</em> and <em><strong>C</strong>ontroller</em>, that's a whole other topic to study, you can take a look <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/">here</a>, <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/mvc-for-noobs--net-10488">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2379-a-better-understanding-of-mvc-model-view-controller-thanks-to-steven-neiland.htm">here</a>!</p>
<p>For those who doesn't know JSP technology, I highly advice to study just a little bit of it before read this article, as this will be our main view technology, it's a great abstraction over the <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaServlets.html">Servlets</a> technology. It simply helps to process Java code on our pages <em>without putting pure java syntax in the middle of our HTML</em>, which would be extremely ugly and hard to maintain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern</h3>
<p>The DAO pattern is a great way to abstract the communication with our database, simply put, the ObjectDAO is a class that will implement the CRUD methods of the Object. This way, our entity class, which is a Java class with only its attributes and their respective getters and setters, won't have to deal directly with the database, you can read more about the DAO pattern <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/dataaccessobject-138824.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The JDBC</h3>
<p>This will be the driver that will abstract the connection with the database, it's pretty simple to use and it's the standard of the oracle, you can read more about it <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/overview-141217.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, the final view of our scenario</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/SmallCRUD1.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<p>And, for any guidance, here's the <strong>project hierarchy</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/smallcrudhierarchy.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
<p>Small and simple step, just create the MySQL scheme that we'll use on this project, that is, just a table person, with name, profession and phone. Here's the code:</p>
<pre>
<code class="sql hljs">
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `smallcrud`.`person` (
  `idperson` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `phone` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `profession` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`idperson`))
</code>
</pre>
<p> </p>
<h3>Creating the model</h3>
<p>We'll create the Person, which will be our Java Bean for Person.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/6c1612d01d4c58c45282.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the connection class</h3>
<p>The connection class will be the responsible for the connection with the database, using the JDBC API, it's fair simple:</p>
<p> </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/ed84ed8467c8e0813eca.js"></script>

<p><em><strong>!important: </strong>These Strings "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simplecrud", "root", "sa" depends on the configuration of the database that you created, the first one is the URI of the database, the second "root" is the user of that database, and the last "sa" is the password of that database</em></p>

<p>So, what happens when we use this class? Every time we call its method "getConnection" it returns a Connection with the database, that will be useful to create Statements, execute SQL Queries and plenty <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html">more</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Creating the PersonDAO</h3>
<p>The PersonDAO will be the class that will manipulate the class Person and communicate with the database, sending persons to database, updating persons, retrieving persons from the DB, which means, the CRUD main methods</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/4177708c2bf222920845.js"></script>

<p> </p>
<h3>Creating the Controller</h3>

<p>This is the most confusing part. All because of the confusion of <strong>not</strong> using JSP file to process the request, so what we will use? <strong>Servlets! </strong> A Servlet fits better in the Controller role, because they won't show anything to the user, it will only get the request data, verify which action the user is trying to make, do something and redirect the user to another page. If you're using JSP files as controllers, probably you're <a href="http://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/37537">doing it wrong</a>. So, basically, our PersonController will take the user request, see if the user is trying to edit, insert, update, remove or retrieve... and do the right thing, pay extremely attention to this code</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/1f86192880faa70760a7.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the View: Index.jsp</h3>

<p>The index will be pretty simple and straight forward, it will just call our controller, passing the action by the get method, in this case, the ListPerson, the Controller will see that the action required is the ListPerson so it will do what it has to do, get all users from the database and list'em.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/bb8cc63c5efb47f59c74.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the View: ListPerson.jsp</h3>

<p>The controller got the action coming from the index and tried to retrieve every person in the database and put all person objects in the session, if there is any Person in the DB, of course. Here is the code to do it, as you can see we’re already using the JSP tags to not use pure Java Scriplets  </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/bcb0acccceeb8a652b8f.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the View: Person.jsp</h3>
<p>This will be the page that the user will be able to insert or edit a Person in the database so it can be loaded on the ListUser.jsp. As the Controller says, if the request has an ID, the Person.jsp will be loaded with a Person, otherwise, it won't. (<em>expecting that the user fill the form to add a new Person to the database</em>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.universocomputacao.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/smallcrudscreen2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74 size-medium" src="http://www.universocomputacao.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/smallcrudscreen2-300x263.png" alt="smallcrudscreen2" width="300" height="263" /></a></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/c312976f8ddb79d71051.js"></script>

<h3>Last details and conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, at the first sight this implementation can be a little confusing, mainly because of the flow logic and the controller built with Servlet, understanding the flow means understanding it as a whole. Make sure you understand the MVC logic and the concepts behind JSP, Servlets and JDBC.</p>

<p>If you're trying to copy the whole code, make sure you import the right libs, including the JSTL, responsible for a few tags I've used in this code. Also i used the Twitter's Bootstrap to help me with the frontend UI.</p>

<p>You can download the code here on my <a href="https://github.com/digorithm/SmallCRUD">GitHub</a></p>

<p>If there's something wrong with your implementation, please let me know, drop me an email or post a comment here and I'll make sure it will work properly! :]</p>

  <div>
    
    <h3 id="what-are-the-main-goals-of-the-object-oriented-programming">What are the main goals of the object-oriented programming?</h3>

<p><em>1. Abstraction, yes, i had to put this in the first place, in my point of view, this is the biggest goal of the OO programming</em></p>

<p>2. Encapsulation, which is a form of abstraction!</p>

<p>3. Reusability</p>

<p>4. Modularity</p>

<p>5. Readability</p>

<p>Let’s say that OO programming did <strong>never</strong> exist, so, i can say that any procedural programmer <em>(C, fortran, cobol, etc..)</em> who has a little notion about how to build organized codes, would, naturally, evolve to an organization that would look like the actual concept of OO programming.</p>

<p>Don’t you think? It would be intuitive, the object-oriented thinking is a quite natural way to think, let me show you… We are used to separate <em>things</em> (from now we’ll call thing as objects) by it’s <em>class</em>, just like the class “Car”, we know GM, wolksvagem, nissan, honda…but they all are cars, right? And we’re also used to say that something <em>inherited</em> some particularities from his precedent… And that’s the idea behind the OO programming, grab the main concept of object and class that defines objects in <strong>real world</strong> and use it on programming!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/dog.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just before the creation of Object-Oriented Programming, the system development in C was using the concept of breaking the big problem into small sub-problems, where each sub-result together would generate the solution of the big problem in question. It’s actually smart to think like this, the OOP languages just formalized this concept (and of course, create others features, but this was the start point). Look at this following problem: We want a data structure to represent the functionaries of determined business, this functionary should have a name, age, salary and a function to change his salary. Let’s deal with it in the smartest way, which is, creating separately some structure that will represent the functionaries, in C we would code something like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct functionary{
  int age;
  char name[50];
  float salary;
}stru_func, *ap_func;

void riseSalary(ap_func pthis){ 
      int n;
      printf("Enter new salary: \n");
      scanf("%d", n);
      pthis-&gt;salary = n;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, in this func.c, we have the structure to represent the functionaries and the function that we will use. (from now, we’ll call function as METHODS)</p>

<p>And here’s the <strong>main code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include "func.c"
int main(){
  stru_func new;
  printf("Enter the age, name and salary: \n");
  scanf("%d", &amp;new.age);
  scanf("%s", &amp;new.name);
  scanf("%f", &amp;new.salary);
  printf ("%d \n", new.age);
  printf ("%s \n", new.name);
  printf ("%f \n", new.salary);
  riseSalary(&amp;new);
  printf("%f", new.salary);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Done, now we have a nice example of class and object…but, made with C! Where the class is this struct called “functionary” and the variables inside it we call “attributes” and the function “riseSalary” we call “method” (obs: look that the function/method is OUTSIDE the struct functionary), in fact we separate the module that represent the functionaries from the main module, and if we want, we can use this functionary module in other problems that need a struct to represent functionaries with those attributes/methods!</p>

<p>And…where’s the object? Right there in the main module, where we created a “variable” called “new” from the struct functionary, this is called “INSTANCE”, in this moment, we create a object from its class! Again, the class is the structure that represent the functionary and the object is the “variable” that we created with this structure!</p>

<p>All these concepts already happened before the creation of the pure Object-Oriented languages, but there was a need of formalize these techniques, creating more rigorous, useful and trustful standards.</p>

<p>The same problem that we solved in C, in java, would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class functionary
{
  public int age;
  public string name;
  public int salary;
  public void riseSalary(int n)
  {
      this.salary = n;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you should have noticed, the method now is INSIDE the structure that represent the functionary (the class). And what the big advantage of this? the class is now more portable, we can reuse it easily!</p>

<p>in the main module we could just create as many object as we want just using: <em>“functionary func = new functionary();”</em></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Of course that the big evolution of procedural to Object-Oriented did not stop there! The concept of reuse, organize and divide the code and the problem created others many famous techniques that we can use on classes and objects, like the <strong>polymorfism</strong>, inheritance, abstract class and many others! But this evolution kept one main goal: <strong>modularity with more abstraction.</strong></p>

  <div>
    
    <p>Well, it all will start with your first steps on studying programming, a very innocent and and naive programming, i mean, your very first “Hello World” and the classics “Read 3 inputs and print the sum of them”, where your concerns will happen because of some missing commas, whitespaces and some misplaced IF’s… things that at first sight may cause a little confusion, you’ll start to think that’s even something hard.</p>

<pre><code>#include
int main(){
printf("Hello World");
return (0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The time will pass, you’ll start to understand logic better, and get impressed with your first program written with 150 lines of pure java code, and this will be you amazed about it</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/amazed.png" alt="images" /></p>

<h3 id="now-youve-become-a-programmer-or-even-better-a-software-engineer-right-we-shall-answer-that-soon-lets-continue-our-timeline"><strong>Now you’ve become a programmer, or even better, a <em>software engineer</em>, right?! we shall answer that soon, let’s continue our timeline…</strong></h3>

<p>You’ll commit yourself to do your first not-so-trivial software project, maybe a stock management system, using some sort of web technology and data persistence with some cool database system. After a few days and some effort, you’ll finish your project and get even more amazed…1500 lines of code!!</p>

<p>Until happen the first problem with your system and you gotta fix it, and you will have to come back to it after 1 month without looking at its code and your first reaction, probably, will be this:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/scared.jpeg" alt="images" /></p>

<p>And you start to suspect <em>“Well…maybe i’m not this Software Engineer thing yet”</em></p>

<p>From this point, you start to study some software development principles, design patterns and how to write reusable and maintainable code and all this stuff. Uff…finally, now you’ll think <em>“i feel more professional now”</em> and that finally you can deal with the industrial world, so you’ll come to a important step:</p>

<h3 id="its-time-to-get-a-software-engineering-internship"><strong>“it’s time to get a software engineering internship”</strong></h3>

<p>Well, I will tell you the consequences from this important decision in 3 phases:</p>

<h3 id="phase-1new-technologies-to-study">Phase 1 — New technologies to study</h3>

<p>After a short search for a internship opportunity, a software company finally will hire you as an intern, and you, with all your experience dealing with code bases that you created by yourself <em>(getting the mark of even 2 thousand lines of code, wow!)</em> will <em>think</em> that you’re prepared… So your manager says some new stuff to study, so you can understand the technologies of the company: J2EE, JPA, Hibernate, JSF, HTTP, FTP, JavaScript, Jquery, AJAX among others, well, you’ll be a little shocked at first, that’s normal, but anyway, you, <strong>strong programmer</strong>, affirms <em>“it’s okay, i can learn it quickly”</em></p>

<p>what bring us to the big shock that is the phase 2…</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-the-company-show-to-you-their-legacy-systems">Phase 2— The company show to you their legacy systems</h3>

<p>Ok, then you studied every concept that were indicated to you to learn on <strong>phase 1</strong>, so, you, with all experience that you have <em>(because you wrote 2 thousand lines of code, right?)</em>, affirms <em>“ I’m ready to work with the company’s systems ”</em>, then, your manager shows to you their system that was written in java, <strong><em>10 years ago, with a total of 700 thousand lines of code without documentation</em></strong> and he says:</p>

<p><em>— “You will be responsible by the maintenance of this system, here’s the code, study it, good luck!”</em></p>

<p>And you, <em>programmer</em>, looks to the code, runs the system, looks to the code again…and your <em>only</em> reaction is:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/depressive.png" alt="images" /></p>

<p>And this is the time that you’ll start to doubt about the universe’s laws. You’ll start to think that nothing makes sense anymore and all your knowledge was a lie…after all…</p>

<p><em>“seriously, what the fuck is this? there’s no way to understand this code, it’s giant, messy, old and nothing makes sense” </em>— you think.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/matrix.gif" alt="This is what the code looks like to you" /></p>

<p>And then, the desperation takes over your thoughts, you realize that everything you learnt on your classes and on <em>codecademy</em> was very different of the real world systems, you don’t know where to start…but after read the code 10000000 times…you, in a <strong>magic</strong> way, gets to the <strong>phase 3</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="phase-3-the-discovery">Phase 3— The discovery</h3>

<p>After much effort and lost nights, you, magically, starts to see patterns in these many lines of code, you start to see a logical flow and the most important thing:</p>

<h3 id="you-start-to-realize-that-even-a-uncommented-code-has-the-power-to-tell-you-a-story">You start to realize that even a uncommented code has the power to tell you a story</h3>

<p><em>“A story? how is that possible?”</em></p>

<p>Exactly, the more time you spent there trying to understand the code, more you started to see <strong>patterns</strong>, it’s like the code could talk by itself, telling what problems they were trying to solve, it’s like you were present at that time when the old engineers were doing a <em>brainstorm</em> to find the solution to certain problem</p>

<p>And you, young future engineer, start to see the logical flow inside those 700 thousand lines of code, and strange as it may sound, you start to mentally talk with the code, and the most amazing, the code starts to answer to you, and it gives you tips and paths to follow so you can understand it better.</p>

<p>And suddenly you reached a state of mental ecstasy, so all your powers got back to your hands and all this messy and dirty code starts to make sense and gain shape:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/matrix2.jpeg" alt="images" /></p>

<p>And then, the following quote from <em>Eric Filson</em> makes a huge sense in your life:</p>

<h3 id="the-art-of-programming-is-finding-patterns-where-others-see-only-chaos"><em>“The art of programming is finding patterns where others see only chaos”</em></h3>

<p>Yes, this is where you really start your love story with the art of software writing, is where you create your extreme connection between your mind and the code, is where you, temporarily, disconnect from the real world and connect yourself to new others universes: <strong>Your systems</strong>.</p>

<p>Where new laws are created and you understand all of them, yes, all of them. Universes which you have total control and you like it. At this moment is created an emotional bond between you and the system, you created it, you own your own universe, use it with responsability, after all, thousand people depend on it.</p>

<p><strong>No matter what happen, don’t give up to understand the logical flow of your new universe, the key to this comprehension is to stay mentally connected to the system, feel it, live it, walk inside it just like the processor, step by step, line by line, command by command, trust me</strong></p>

<h2 id="you-will-find-the-pattern-inside-the-chaos"><strong>You will find the pattern inside the chaos.</strong></h2>
