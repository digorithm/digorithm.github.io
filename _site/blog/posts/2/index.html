  <div>
    
    <p>Are you total lost in this world full of jargons like: API, Rest API, microservices and stuffs? Come here, sit, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s talk briefly about it.</p>

<p>Today a lot is said about APIs. Everything has an API, every programmer (newbie to expert) uses tons of API. Also, today we can see a lot of people talking about microservices and the idea of total separation of backend, frontend, web services or <em>whatever</em>. So we can <em>(and we do)</em> hear a lot about REST/RESTful APIs. We have 3 current problems with it:</p>

<p>1. Many new programmers don’t have a single clue of what a Rest API is.</p>

<p>2. It’s probable that they’re using Rest APIs and don’t know about it.</p>

<p>3. When they feel that they should learn more about it, there’s hardly any good and accessible material to learn it.</p>

<h3 id="so-heres-a-extremely-simplistic-approach-to-try-to-explain-what-is-a-rest-api">So here’s a extremely simplistic approach to try to explain what is a Rest API</h3>

<p>Starting with the concept of API, which stands for <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface, it’s just an interface which you, <em>dear programmer</em>, will be dealing with to extract whatever you <em>(or your program)</em> want.</p>

<p>Suppose your program needs to create a connection with a given database, normally you do:</p>

<p>1. You import the <em>library</em> that will abstract the connection with the database</p>

<p>2. You create an object to represent a Connection with the database</p>

<p>3. You call functions that this object provide to you, so you can do whatever you want (and whatever they provide)</p>

<p>Here’s a silly example:</p>

<pre><code>from database_library import Connection

connection = Connection()
connection.OpenConnection()
… do whatever you want
connection.CloseConnection()
</code></pre>

<p>When you called those function, you were dealing with the interface that the object provided to you, sure the object may be doing thousand of things at the moment you call its functions, but, it doesn’t matter to you, does it? You just want the <em>damn</em> connection open and then closed.</p>

<p>So the library that you imported is giving you something you want, offering a service or a resource. That’s the sole purpose of an API. It’s a layer that you can use to get things from other(s) component(s).</p>

<p>So, it’s easy to deduct that, the better the engineer planned the API, the easier it will be to deal with and extract what you want, and the contrary is true.</p>

<p>But still, you’re processing the core of this API in your own machine, which isn’t that great, here’s when the API evolves to whole web hosted services, so you can request this API something, and this API can give you something, through the WEB, via HTTP request. And that’s amazing.</p>

<p>And the community, recently, decided that the request and response that happen between applications and APIs, should be done with JSON, so this communication can become uniform and APIs can talk to other APIs effortlessly.</p>

<p>So, basically, what’s going on is:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/json-rest3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So… yes, you make your function calls, now, with just a simple URL + HTTP methods, wanna see a real example? We can just send a request to the Facebook’s API by accessing this URL: <a href="http://graph.facebook.com/contatodigo">http://graph.facebook.com/contatodigo</a></p>

<p>Which will request my profile’s data, and the Facebook’s API will return:</p>

<pre><code>{
   "id": "100001638888259",
   "first_name": "Rodrigo",
   "gender": "male",
   "last_name": "Ara\u00fajo",
   "link": "https://www.facebook.com/contatodigo",
   "locale": "pt_BR",
   "name": "Rodrigo Ara\u00fajo",
   "username": "contatodigo"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As simple as that.</p>

<p>Now with this basic idea explained, we can do a simple Rest API using Python and Flask. (I’m assuming you’re already familiar with both technologies).</p>

<p>All we’re gonna do is, using the flask routing, create routes to the users so they can interact with the resources of our API. Let’s suppose our API will serve and receive only Books. So this is the resource we’re dealing with, users may use our API to get Books and insert new Books, so our only URIs will be:</p>

<p>1. <em>/bookapi/v1.0/books</em> with a GET method, which will just return the list of books</p>

<p>2. <em>/bookapi/v1.0/books</em> with a POST method, which will insert a book</p>

<p>So after the API is built, you or you program can get books or insert books by sending HTTP request to the API’s URIs, simple as that. I’ll be very straight forward, here’s the code:</p>

<pre><code>#!flask/bin/python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

books = [
    {
        'id': 1,
        'title': u'Game of Thrones',
        'description': u'Cool dragons', 
        'finished': False
    },
    {
        'id': 2,
        'title': u'50 shadows of grey',
        'description': u'It start as bullshit, end as a huge bullshit', 
        'finished': True
    }
]

@app.route('/bookapi/v1.0/books/', methods=['GET'])
def get_books():
    return jsonify({'books': books})

@app.route('/bookapi/v1.0/books', methods=['POST'])
def create_book():
    if not request.json or not 'title' in request.json:
        abort(404)

    book = {
            'id': books[-1]['id'] + 1,
            'title': request.json['title'],
            'description': request.json.get('description', ""),
            'finished': False
            }

    books.append(book)
    return jsonify({'book': book}), 201 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we’re creating a simple in-memory <em>database</em>, which is a simple python’s dict. This could be a database. But for the sake of simplicity, I’m using just a dict.</p>

<p>When the requests come, it verifies the route that the user is asking for, which is: what resources is he/she wanting? and then, the code do whatever it must do (<em>remember the API idea of hiding the complexity, the user requesting just want the result</em>), and then it put everything in a JSON and returns it. That simple!</p>

<p>Of course, many improvements and extensions (<em>there are infinity possibilities</em>) can be made to this code, but, here’s a skeleton of the idea of an API, it’s just a start. One good practice it’s to <em>not</em> return the ID of the resource, but return just its URI, which is surely a great idea. Another good practice is to ask authentication in every HTTP request, so your API won’t be exposed to everybody. There are, indeed, endless improvements, but in this code, you, that are completely beginner to the API’s concept, can now understand what’s going on underneath and start planning and building your own API using Flask.</p>

    <a href="/general/setup/demo/2015/03/31/using-python-and-AI-to-predict-types-of-wine.html">Using Python and AI to predict types of wine</a>
  </h2>

  <div class="post-date" style="margin-bottom:15px; margin-top:-15px;">
    
    March
    31st,
    
    2015
  </div>


  <div>
    
    <p>I’ve been working with AI/Machine Learning at <a href="http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/">Jusbrasil</a> recently, and it’s being pretty challenging due to the <em>huge</em> amount of data that we have to deal with, so cleaning this data and making predictions and classifications in an acceptable time demands a nice AI architecture.</p>

<p>That said I can say that I’m extremely thankful for a few technologies that are helping me go through this challenge <em>(and the pain of cleaning this amount of data)</em>: Python, Scikit Learn, Pandas, and the whole stack that the Scikit Learn use, such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and few others.</p>

<p>So, this inspired me to <em>spread the word</em>, so I’ll be showing here a simple example of Machine Learning using Python, Pandas and Scikit Learn to predict, given a great amount of data/features about wines, if a wine is white or red.</p>

<p><strong>disclaimer:</strong> <em>I’m assuming that you already have a small knowledge on the ideas of the machine learning and its mathematical aspects (although not necessary to implement the code that I’ll show here), this is just a simple introduction to scikit learn and its power, so the example is pretty simple and straight forward, if you just want the code, here it is: <a href="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/ad742f9314f76e732888">github link</a></em></p>

<h2 id="whats-pandas">What’s Pandas?</h2>

<p>Pandas is an amazing library for data manipulation, it makes the process of dealing with data very easy and straight forward, we can work with CSV, JSON and plenty other formats without struggling to manipulate the data, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">give it five minutes</a> and skim their <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/">docs</a>, it will definitely worth it!</p>

<h2 id="fetching-the-data">Fetching the data</h2>

<p>Let’s start fetching the data with Pandas, <em>(you can download the data <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/">here</a>)</em> to do so, just import Pandas and read the CSV file, just like that:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
import pandas as pd
reds = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
whites = pd.read_csv('winequality-white.csv', sep=';')
</code>
</pre>

<p>We can see how the data is structured by doing a few commands:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
reds.values[0:6]
</code>
</pre>

<p>As output, we have the first 5 rows of the red wine’s data</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
array([[7.4, 0.7, 0.0, 1.9, 0.076, 11.0, 34.0, 0.9978, 3.51, 0.56, 9.4, 5],
       [7.8, 0.88, 0.0, 2.6, 0.098, 25.0, 67.0, 0.9968, 3.2, 0.68, 9.8, 5],
       [7.8, 0.76, 0.04, 2.3, 0.092, 15.0, 54.0, 0.997, 3.26, 0.65, 9.8, 5],
       [11.2, 0.28, 0.56, 1.9, 0.075, 17.0, 60.0, 0.998, 3.16, 0.58, 9.8,6],
       [7.4, 0.7, 0.0, 1.9, 0.076, 11.0, 34.0, 0.9978, 3.51, 0.56, 9.4, 5],
       [7.4, 0.66, 0.0, 1.8, 0.075, 13.0, 40.0, 0.9978, 3.51, 0.56, 9.4, 5]], 
dtype=object)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Or we just use a function from Pandas that describe very well our data</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
reds.head()
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">

&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.dataframe'=""&gt;Int64Index: 5 entries, 0 to 4
Data columns:
fixed acidity           5  non-null values
volatile acidity        5  non-null values
citric acid             5  non-null values

dtypes: float64(11), int64(1), object(1)
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="understanding-our-data">Understanding our data</h2>

<p>Matplotlib gives you many ways to plot our data into graphs so we can understand what is going on with the data so we can choose the best model/algorithm for the given scenario,</p>

<p>For instance, let’s take a look at the relation between the red wines and its fixed acidity</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
x = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(reds.index, reds.get("fixed acidity"), 'ro')
ax.set_title('Wines vs fixed acidity')
ax.set_xlabel('red wine index')
ax.set_ylabel('Fixed Acidity')
plt.show()
</code>
</pre>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/mlproblem.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-data-for-classification">Preparing the Data for classification</h2>

<p>Now we’re going to add a new feature/variable to our data, which is our target variable, the <em>Y</em>, that will be telling if the wine from our dataset is white or red</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
reds['kind'] = 'red'
whites['kind'] = 'white'
</code>
</pre>

<p>We need to get all of our feature into a vector called X, that will be set into our algorithm, right? And, we need to get all our targets (white or red) and set into a Y variable</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
wines = reds.append(whites, ignore_index=True)
X = wines.ix[:, 0:-1]
y = wines.kind
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that we’re merging both datasets together, the one with the red wines and the one with the white wines, so we can send them together to the algorithm. Now we’re going to binarize the labels ‘white’ and ‘red’, so the mathematical model can use it. It’s pretty simple</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
y = y.apply(lambda val: 0 if val == 'white' else 1)
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The algorithm</h2>

<p>Now that we have our data well structured and we do understand it, we can start looking for an algorithm to use. A good algorithm for our scenario is a simple <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>, that will return a model that we’ll use to make our predictions/classification. The mathematical linear model that will use is the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 
f(w) := \lambda\, R(w) + \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n L(w;x_i,y_i) \label{eq:regPrimal}\

</script>

<p>In addition with the loss function defined by the logistic loss</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
L(w;x,y) := \log(1+\exp( -y w^T x )) 
</script>

<p>The Scikit learn provides an awesome library with an amazingly ease of use, so that we don’t have to implement the whole model from scratch. All we have to do is create a object from the model we want to use, understand how it works <em>(at least understand how to use its interface to do what we want)</em>. In this case, we will be using the <em>cross validation</em> object, which is another discussion for another time, but in a few words, it will divide our dataset and test it against all parts of the divided dataset, this way we make sure that we’re validating the quality of the result.</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
clf = LogisticRegression()
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)
print scores.mean(), scores.std()
</code>
</pre>

<p>And as the result we get:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python hljs">
0.981376321334 0.00638795038332
</code>
</pre>

<p>And that’s the exactly the precision of the algorithm over the given dataset, <strong>98% of precision</strong>, which is quite good! Now, for example, we can save this trained classifier and use it for future classifications of incoming data about wines that need to be classified as white or red, to do so, we just call the method <em>clf.predict(X)</em> where this X will be the new wine’s data. simplicity at its best!</p>

  <div>
    
    <h2 id="how-can-we-make-a-machine-learn-from-data">How can we make a machine learn from data?</h2>

<p>Then, how can we make the machine predicts things based on that learned data? Those are the question answered by one of the most classic Machine Learning Algorithms, the <strong>Gradient Descent Algorithm</strong>, from a Mathematical-Statistical side it’s called <strong>Univariate Linear Regression</strong>.</p>

<p>This is one of the tools of the Machine Learning toolbox, and what it tries to do is to model a relationship between a scalar dependent variable Y and a explanatory variable X.</p>

<h2 id="in-laymans-term">In Layman’s term…</h2>

<p>Let’s suppose you have a few points distributed in a Graph, so you already know that in a point A you have a well defined X and Y, which means, if you input X, your output will be Y, and in a point B you have a well defined X’ and Y’ as well. But, thing is, if a point emerge between A and B, and you only have the X… what will be the Y <em>(the output)</em>?</p>

<p>What this algorithm does is: <strong>It tries to predict this Y value, based on the previous data</strong>! Amazing, right?</p>

<p>At the end of the execution, you’ll have a full trend line that you can use to predict values! just like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/linearRegression.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="the-theory-behind-it">The Theory Behind It</h2>

<p>I’ll cover a few theories about this algorithm here, but, it won’t be complete, as this demand a great coverage of mathematical material that if I would write it all here, It would be a <em>long, long</em>, <strong>very</strong> <em>long</em> post. So I’m assuming that you’re already familiar with Calculus <em>(Sums, Partial Derivatives)</em>, Statistics and Discrete Mathematics.</p>

<p>So, our goal here is to <strong>fit the best straight line in our initial data</strong>, right?</p>

<p>Thus, we need something to represent this straight line, which will be our hypothesis function:</p>

<div id="math"> 
$ h_{\Theta}(x) = \Theta_{0} + \Theta_{1}x $ 
</div>

<p>Where this \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) are the parameters of the function, and <strong>finding the best parameters for this function is what is going to give us the correct straight line to plot on our data</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of what we’re trying to do, which is, fit the best straight line in the data:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/Linear-regression.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So what we want to do is to find a \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) so our Hypothesis outputs can be very close to the real Y output.</p>

<p>Formally we want:</p>

<div id="math">$ \underset{\Theta_{0}\Theta_{1}}{min}(h_{\Theta}(x) - y)^2 $</div>

<p>So we want <strong>minimize</strong> \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) so the difference between the <strong>Hypothesis</strong> and the <strong>real output</strong> is minimal.</p>

<p><strong>But we want it for every point in our data</strong>, which is \(x(i)\) <em>(which is the i-th x of our data)</em>, so we want the <strong>sum of this average</strong>, which is, formally:</p>

<div id="math"> 
$ \underset{\Theta_{0}\Theta_{1}}{min}\,\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{0}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>And we’re going to call this function <strong>Cost Function</strong>, with the following notation:</p>

<div id="math"> 
$ J(\Theta_{0}, \Theta_{1}) = \,\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{0}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>So, our goals is to <strong>minimize this cost function</strong>:</p>

<div id="math"> 
$ \underset{\Theta_{0}\Theta_{1}}{min}\,\, J(\Theta_{0}, \Theta_{1}) $
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This cost function is also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">Square Error Function</a>.</p>

<h3 id="now-the-gradient-descent-algorithm">Now, the gradient descent algorithm</h3>

<p>With our cost function built, we need to “keep” finding values for \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) so we can reach our ideal trend line. So, basically:</p>

<p>1. We start with some \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \)</p>

<p>2. keep changing \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) to reduce our cost function \( J(\Theta_{0}, \Theta_{1}) \), until we find the minimum.</p>

<p>That’s quite simple and intuitive, right? There’s a lot of intuitive explanation and more visual examples of what this algorithm is doing in the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/ml-007/">machine learning course taught by Andrews Ng (From Stanford)</a>.</p>

<p>What this algorithm will be doing is: partially derive our cost function for \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) simultaneously, so we can find the minimum value for them, with every iteration updating our \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) with their new value!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>- Meh, talk is cheap show me the math!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Formally, the algorithm is:</p>

<div id="math">
$ repeat \, until \, convergence\,\{ \\ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \Theta_{j} := \Theta_{j} - \alpha \frac{\partial }{\partial \Theta_{j}} \,\, J(\Theta_{0}, \Theta_{1}) \\ \} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, $
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p><em><strong>Make sure that this will run for j = 0 and j = 1.</strong></em></p>

<p>But, pay attention, this is the generic version, the \( \Theta_{j} \) represent both \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \).</p>

<p>What the algorithm is saying is that we’ll be doing this procedure to \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) at the same time! So, we can put it in this way:</p>

<div id="math">
$ repeat \, until \, convergence\,\{ \\ \Theta_{0} := \Theta_{0} - \alpha \frac{\partial }{\partial \Theta_{0}} \,\, J(\Theta_{0}, \Theta_{1}) \\ \Theta_{1} := \Theta_{1} - \alpha \frac{\partial }{\partial \Theta_{1}} \,\, J(\Theta_{0}, \Theta_{1}) \\ \} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\ $
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Also, we can expand the <strong>Cost Function</strong> that is being derived, doing this, it will be exactly what I’ll be putting into code soon, so, our <strong>final algorithm</strong> is:</p>

<div id="math">
$ repeat \, until \, convergence\,\{ \\ \Theta_{0} := \Theta_{0} - \alpha \frac{\partial }{\partial \Theta_{0}} \,\, \Big (\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{\Theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \Big) \\ \Theta_{1} := \Theta_{1} - \alpha \frac{\partial }{\partial \Theta_{1}} \,\, \Big (\frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{\Theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \Big) \\ \}
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\ $
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Now it’s time to code all of it!</strong></p>

<p>First things first, we’ll be using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmathplot/">Google’s JMathPlot</a> to plot graphs using Java and Swing to use its JFrame, we shall start with our class to represent our <strong>Initial Data</strong>, which will be the <strong>Training Set</strong>.</p>
<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    import javax.swing.JFrame;
    import org.math.plot.*;

    public class InitialData{
            public static double[] x = {2, 4, 6, 8};
            public static double[] y = {2, 5, 5, 8};

            public void plotData(){
                    Plot2DPanel plot = new Plot2DPanel();
                    plot.addScatterPlot("X-Y", this.x, this.y);
                    JFrame frame = new JFrame("Original X-Y Data");
                    frame.setContentPane(plot);
                    frame.setSize(600, 600);
                    frame.setVisible(true);
            }
    }
</code>
</pre>

<p><br />
To try out the data plotting, create a main class and call <em>plotData()</em> from <strong>InitialData.java</strong>, so we can have this:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/example-plot.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we’re going to take our first steps on writing the <strong>GradientDescent.java</strong>, we must be very careful here. Let’s start with the main settings and parameters of it:</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    import javax.swing.JFrame;
    import org.math.plot.*;

    public class GradientDescent{
            private double theta0;
            private double theta1;

            private int trendline;

            // Algorithm settings
        double alpha = 0.01;  // learning rate
        double tol = 1e-11;   // tolerance to determine convergence
        int maxiter = 9000;   // maximum number of iterations in case convergence is not reached
        int dispiter = 100;   // interval for displaying results during iterations
        int iters = 0;

        //track of results
        double[] theta0plot = new double[maxiter+1];
        double[] theta1plot = new double[maxiter+1];
        double[] tplot = new double[maxiter+1];

        InitialData initial_data;

        Plot2DPanel plot;

        public GradientDescent(InitialData id){
                    //initial guesses
            this.theta0 = 0;
            this.theta1 = 0;
            this.initial_data = id;

            plot = new Plot2DPanel();
            plot.addScatterPlot("X-Y", initial_data.x, initial_data.y);
            JFrame frame = new JFrame("Final X-Y Data");
            frame.setContentPane(plot);
            frame.setSize(600, 600);
            frame.setVisible(true);
        }
    [...]
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now let me explain a few details of this part:</p>

<p><strong>Alpha</strong> is the <strong>Learning Rate</strong>, it’s a <em>dangerous variable</em>, it’s used to set the size of the step that the algorithm will take while trying to find the \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \), that’s the learning rate of the algorithm. If Alpha is <strong>too low</strong>, the algorithm can be very slow, although very precise, if Alpha is <strong>higher</strong>, it will be taking <strong>larger steps</strong>, which can be <strong>faster</strong>, or <strong>dangerous</strong>, causing the algorithm to <strong>DIVERGE</strong>, which, <em>trust me</em>, you don’t want this! <em>(Andrew Ng explain this part very well in its course)</em></p>

<p>The variable <strong>TrendLine</strong> is what we’ll use to plot the straight line which is our main goal.</p>

<p>The <strong>tol</strong> variable is our safe move in case of a dangerous convergence, which means, in case of convergence, it will stop the execution.</p>

<p>The other variables and objects in this part are very intuitive to understand, it’s auto explainable! <em>(forgive if i’m wrong, just say something and I’ll put more detail on that)</em>.</p>

<p>About the Constructor, we’re saying that our initial guesses for \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) is 0. The rest is just data plotting.</p>

<p><strong>next: our Hypothesis Function</strong> <em>(that will be doing exactly as the model that I did show above)</em></p>
<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    public double hypothesisFunction(double x){
            return this.theta1*x + theta0;
        }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, our two function to derive our \( \Theta \), again, it will be doing exactly the same as the mathematical model, there’s no magic!</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    public double deriveTheta1(){
            double sum = 0;

            for (int j=0; j&lt;initial_data.x.length; j++){
                    sum += (initial_data.y[j] - hypothesisFunction(initial_data.x[j])) * initial_data.x[j];
            }
            return -2 * sum / initial_data.x.length;
        }

        public double deriveTheta0(){
            double sum = 0;

            for (int j=0; j&lt;initial_data.x.length; j++) {
                    sum += initial_data.y[j] - hypothesisFunction(initial_data.x[j]);
            }
            return -2 * sum / initial_data.x.length;

        }
</code>
</pre>

<p><br />
Now, the <strong>Gradient Descent Algorithm</strong> <em>per se</em>, making use of the functions above:</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    public void execute(){
            do {

                    this.theta1 -= alpha * deriveTheta1();
                    this.theta0 -= alpha * deriveTheta0();

                    //used for plotting
                    tplot[iters] = iters;
                    theta0plot[iters] = theta0;
                    theta1plot[iters] = theta1;
                    iters++;

                    if (iters % dispiter == 0){
                            addTrendLine(plot, true);

                    }

                    if (iters &gt; maxiter) break;
            } while (Math.abs(theta1) &gt; tol || Math.abs(theta0) &gt; tol);
            plot.addScatterPlot("X-Y", initial_data.x, initial_data.y);
            System.out.println("theta0 = " + this.theta0 + " and theta1 = " + this.theta1);
        }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that it does <em>almost</em> exactly the same as the mathematical model of the Gradient Descent demonstrated above, the difference is only a few details, such as the <em>if</em> and <em>while</em> to verify convergence or divergence <em>(which is, if it reached the iteration’s limit)</em></p>

<p>Next we have the <strong>addTrendLine</strong> function, used to keep plotting our straight line as it will become more updated.</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    public void addTrendLine(Plot2DPanel plot, boolean removePrev){
            if (removePrev){
                    plot.removePlot(trendline);
            }
            double[] yEnd = new double[initial_data.x.length];
            for (int i=0; i&lt;initial_data.x.length; i++)
                    yEnd[i] = hypothesisFunction(initial_data.x[i]);
            trendline = plot.addLinePlot("final", initial_data.x, yEnd);
        }
</code>
</pre>

<p>And now we have an extra, it’s a function to store and plot the convergence history of both \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \), so we can see how it happened.</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    public void printConvergence(){

          double[] theta0plot2 = new double[iters];
          double[] theta1plot2 = new double[iters];
          double[] tplot2 = new double[iters];
          System.arraycopy(theta0plot, 0, theta0plot2, 0, iters);
          System.arraycopy(theta1plot, 0, theta1plot2, 0, iters);
          System.arraycopy(tplot, 0, tplot2, 0, iters);

          // Plot the convergence of data
          Plot2DPanel convPlot = new Plot2DPanel();

          // add a line plot to the PlotPanel
          convPlot.addLinePlot("theta0", tplot2, theta0plot2);
          convPlot.addLinePlot("theta1", tplot2, theta1plot2);

          // put the PlotPanel in a JFrame, as a JPanel
          JFrame frame2 = new JFrame("Convergence of parameters over time");
          frame2.setContentPane(convPlot);
          frame2.setSize(600, 600);
          frame2.setVisible(true);
        }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Finally, we have our <strong>Test Class</strong>, that will execute everything:</p>

<pre>
<code class="java hljs">
    import javax.swing.JFrame;

    import org.math.plot.*;

    public class TestGradDescent {
            public static void main(String[] args ){
                    InitialData id = new InitialData();
                    id.plotData();
                    GradientDescent gd = new GradientDescent(id);
                    gd.execute();
                    gd.printConvergence();

            }
    }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, executing the code, the output will be, at first, the initial data:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/example-plot-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Executing the algorithm, it learns and generate its prediction based on its initial data:</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/example-plot-line-e1420763780646.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="magical-right">Magical, right?</h2>

<p>And then, we can see the <strong>convergence</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/example-convergence.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And you can see in the terminal the final values of \( \Theta_{0} \) and \( \Theta_{1} \) that minimized the Cost Function.</p>

<p><em>If it wasn’t Science, probably would be black magic. heh.</em></p>

<h2 id="a-few-considerations">A few considerations</h2>

<p>You can download the complete code <a href="https://github.com/digorithm/ArtificialIntelligenceAlgorithms">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions/suggestion, drop me an email so we can talk!</p>

<p>If you need further details of the mathematical model, I ultra advice to watch Andrew’s Ng Videos at Stanford@Coursera. <strong>His skills to teach it is something unbelievable awesome</strong>.</p>

  </h2>

  <div class="post-date" style="margin-bottom:15px; margin-top:-15px;">
    
    January
    6th,
    
    2015
  </div>


  <div>
    
    <p>The first thought I had when I started to study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Design Patterns</a> was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>- “damn, is all this really necessary?”</em>	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, so many patterns, so many details to do things that look simple to do without any further detailed thoughts. And I started to question myself if this was really a productive thing. The first answer I gave was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>-”no, *wonderful not-bad-word* this, I’m losing too much time trying to wrap my head around this”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I forgot it and kept developing my software using something like <a href="https://gist.github.com/banaslee/4147370#file-xgh-en-txt">Extreme Go Horse</a>. (i was younger at that time). Then, I saw a pattern being formed:</p>

<h3 id="every-time-i-came-back-to-my-old-codes-i-couldnt-extend-nor-debbug-it-in-a-easy-way-it-was-always-extremely-hard-to-work-on-it">Every time I came back to my old codes I couldn’t extend nor debbug it in a easy way. It was always extremely hard to work on it.</h3>

<p>And then I realized why: <strong>lack of good architectural decisions.</strong></p>

<p>So I decided to give another chance to learning Design Patterns and finally I understood its beauty.</p>

<h2 id="few-things-to-keep-in-mind">Few things to keep in mind:</h2>

<p>1. It’s not about trying to fit every problem in every Design Pattern. That’s just a waste of time</p>

<p>2. It may be not very productive at start, the process of applying a DP in a determined problem takes time.</p>

<p>3. On the other hand, it will be extremely productive when you try to debug your code or try to extend it. Everything starts to make more sense and it’s way easier to change things when you’ve followed some patterns</p>

<p>4. When studying a Design Pattern, try hard to implement that solution in a problem. This will make total difference</p>

<h2 id="now-to-the-materials">Now, to the materials!</h2>

<p>Start with the classics:</p>

<h4 id="design-patternshttpwwwamazoncomdesign-patterns-object-oriented-professional-computingdp0201634988-aka-gang-of-four"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Professional-Computing/dp/0201634988">Design Patterns</a> (a.k.a Gang of Four)</h4>

<p>This is the all times classic. These four gentlemen were the firsts to formalized and compile all patterns found on Object Oriented Systems. Here my advice is to go one by one, pick a pattern, read it, understand it, implement it and ,finally, really understand it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4 id="head-first-design-patternshttpwwwamazoncomhead-first-design-patterns-freemandp0596007124"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124">Head First Design Patterns</a></h4>

<p>This one I’ve used when I didn’t understand a concept from the Gang of Four, it is easier to grasp the concepts, the approach is way less hardcore than the original GoF, but it still is a great book.</p>

<h3 id="code-samples">Code Samples</h3>

<p>That said, it’s always good to have examples of each Design Pattern by your side, so you can study the DP and check other examples, so real world examples are perfect for it:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1673841/examples-of-gof-design-patterns/2707195#2707195">List with Examples of Patterns implemented in the Java SE and EE API</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns">List with Examples of patterns demonstrated with C#</a></p>

<p><a href="http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">Excellent examples and explanations of each Design Pattern</a></p>

<p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns">Another great material on Design Patterns, with lots of great thoughts on it</a></p>

<p>I believe this is a good start to learn Design Pattern and I hope this helps someone, mainly if they’re struggling with the same doubts I had when trying to learn it.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing: <strong>Do not ever go Extreme Go Horse, really.</strong></p>

    <p>I’ve been reading many texts on automata theory these times, and let me tell you, that’s such a wonderful thing. It pretty much explain how computers can…. compute! Simply put, Automata Theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as Automata.</p>

<p>From the mathematical models to represent it to the fun programming implementations, it’s really great and exciting to study it!</p>

<p>Automatons are abstract models of machines that perform computations on an input by moving through a series of states or configurations. At each state of the computation, a transition function determines the next configuration on the basis of a finite portion of the present configuration. As a result, once the computation reaches an accepting configuration, it accepts that input. The most general and powerful automata is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>.</p>

<p>In layman’s terms, FSM <em>(Finite State Machine)</em> or Automaton is a device <em>(hardware or software)</em> that responds to external events and produces actions. The actions generated depend on the past history of the system, i.e. its state.</p>

<p>This can go from a simple reserved word analyzer</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/thenautomata2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To big Regular Expressions:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/bigdfa.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Automatons are also essentials to understand the <strong>limits of the computation</strong>, thus, we have now two important problems coming out from this thought:</p>

<p>1. What computers can do?</p>

<p>2. What computers can do efficiently?</p>

<p>The first one is called <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse322/08sp/lec20.pdf">Decidability</a> and the second one is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability">intractability</a></p>

<p>And it brings our minds to the very beginning of the Computing Science, where many scientist were thinking about the limits of computation, not that today there aren’t many scientists working on it, but today many programmers, sadly, ignore this kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>But, returning to our automatons, they’re represented by a bunch of states that we represent formally as \( Q \), a finite set of symbols ( \( \sum \) ), a transition function ( \( \delta \) ) that has two parameters: a state \( Q \) and a symbol, this function is responsible for the change of states in the automaton. An initial State from \( Q \) and a acceptance state also from \( Q \).</p>

<p>So we can say that a generic automaton can be represented formally as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
A = \left ( Q, \sum, \delta, q0, F \right ) 
</script>

<p>The automatons fall into two classifications, they can be:</p>

<h2 id="deterministic">Deterministic</h2>

<p>Where they can’t be at more than one state at the same time, it’s the real world way to represent abstracts machines, because this kind of automaton has no ambiguity . Here’s a simple example of an DFA <em>(Deterministic Finite Automaton)</em> that only accepts string having 001 as substring.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/dfaex1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Informally speaking, if you put a string of 0s and 1s such as 10011 and process it number by number, following the states changes you will see that it will end the processing and your current state will be the acceptance state, so, this string is acceptable! So a string such as 11101010, if you try the same process, won’t end at an acceptable state, so we say that this string is not acceptable by this automaton.</p>

<h2 id="non-deterministic">Non Deterministic</h2>

<p>In this case, the automaton can change to multiple states at the same time, which means, it’s not so deterministic and precise as the deterministic automaton. So why one would use this non deterministic automaton? Simply put, it’s way easier to design a NFA (Non deterministic Finite Automaton) to solve a determined problem than to design a precise DFA to solve this same problem.</p>

<p><strong>But! We’ve a problem here!</strong></p>

<p><em>How can a computer, which is an unambiguous machine, process something that is not deterministic?</em></p>

<p><strong>It can’t. And it won’t!</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/pergunta.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>So why in the seven hells would i want to use this NFA if the machine can’t understand?</em></p>

<p>The answer is, every NFA has an equivalent DFA, which means, if a language is recognized by the NFA and by the DFA, they’re equivalent. All you have to do is <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/LexicalPart3.pdf">translate</a> the NFA into a DFA so the machine can use it!</p>

<h3 id="talking-about-language-what-is-it-in-this-context">Talking about Language, what is it in this context?</h3>

<p>Well, this is what we call <strong>Regular Language</strong> which is a Language L accepted by an Automaton, <strong>so the language of an Automaton is the set of all string that it accepts.</strong></p>

<p>We can define the language of a DFA as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 
L(A) = \{ \omega \,|\, \delta(q0, \omega)\, is\, in\, F \}
</script>

<p>Which means, an Automaton processing a string, from its initial state, being computed by its transition function, if the processing ends in the acceptance state, this means that this is the language of this DFA.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-next-steps-and-further-readings">Conclusion, next steps and further readings</h2>

<p>As you may have noticed, there are unimaginable ways to use Automatons, it wasn’t even created to apply directly in the Computer Science, two neurophysiologists, were the first to present a description of finite Automata in 1943. Their paper, entitled, “A Logical Calculus Immanent in Nervous Activity”, had a huge impact in the computer science.</p>

<p>For anyone who’s trying to dive deeper in this field, I strongly advice the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Languages-Computation-Edition/dp/0321455363">Ullman’s book on Automata and Complexity Theory</a></p>

<p>And soon I pretend to write few more thing on Automata, such as techniques to translate a NFA to a DFA using the algorithm of subset construction.</p>

<p>For now my main goal was to simply introduce this beautiful branch of the Computer Science and Mathematics and show its applications.</p>

<p>If something isn’t clear to you, drop me an email and let’s talk about it! :)</p>
