  <h2>
    <a href="/general/setup/demo/2014/07/22/CRUD-with-Java,-JSP,-and-MySQL.html">CRUD with Java, JSP and MySQL</a>
  </h2>

  <div class="post-date" style="margin-bottom:15px; margin-top:-15px;">
    
    July
    22nd,
    
    2014
  </div>


  <div>
    
    <p>One of the most common kind of applications in today's tech/business world is the CRUD system, that is the idea of the user interacting with a database, so the user can Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete <em>(yep, that awful name came from this)</em> data from this database. Also, <strong>learning how to create a CRUD with a language is a great way to understand the basics of this language, the basics of software design, engineering and architecture.</strong> In layman's term, a CRUD page is just a page where you can insert a thing, edit that thing, search that thing and delete that thing, just that!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our goal</h3>
<p>Well, our scenario will be the simplest possible, so we can understand how to communicate with our database, so, it will be a simple contact book web app where we can do our CRUD with persons. This person will have <!--more--> a name, a phone number and a profession. We'll have a button to add a new person, a form to enter this new person's information, a page where will be loaded all persons from the database and buttons to edit and remove each person</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/smallcrudscreen-1024x300.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<p> 
 </p>
<h3>Our Technology Stack</h3>
<p>We'll be using Java as our backend technology, Java ServerPages(JSP) as our view technology and MySQL as our relational database. Also, we'll be using the MVC architecture, which is the idea of separating the code by <em><strong>M</strong>odel</em>, <em><strong>V</strong>iew</em> and <em><strong>C</strong>ontroller</em>, that's a whole other topic to study, you can take a look <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/">here</a>, <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/mvc-for-noobs--net-10488">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2379-a-better-understanding-of-mvc-model-view-controller-thanks-to-steven-neiland.htm">here</a>!</p>
<p>For those who doesn't know JSP technology, I highly advice to study just a little bit of it before read this article, as this will be our main view technology, it's a great abstraction over the <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaServlets.html">Servlets</a> technology. It simply helps to process Java code on our pages <em>without putting pure java syntax in the middle of our HTML</em>, which would be extremely ugly and hard to maintain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern</h3>
<p>The DAO pattern is a great way to abstract the communication with our database, simply put, the ObjectDAO is a class that will implement the CRUD methods of the Object. This way, our entity class, which is a Java class with only its attributes and their respective getters and setters, won't have to deal directly with the database, you can read more about the DAO pattern <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/dataaccessobject-138824.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The JDBC</h3>
<p>This will be the driver that will abstract the connection with the database, it's pretty simple to use and it's the standard of the oracle, you can read more about it <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/overview-141217.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, the final view of our scenario</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/SmallCRUD1.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<p>And, for any guidance, here's the <strong>project hierarchy</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/smallcrudhierarchy.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
<p>Small and simple step, just create the MySQL scheme that we'll use on this project, that is, just a table person, with name, profession and phone. Here's the code:</p>
<pre>
<code class="sql hljs">
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `smallcrud`.`person` (
  `idperson` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `phone` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `profession` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`idperson`))
</code>
</pre>
<p> </p>
<h3>Creating the model</h3>
<p>We'll create the Person, which will be our Java Bean for Person.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/6c1612d01d4c58c45282.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the connection class</h3>
<p>The connection class will be the responsible for the connection with the database, using the JDBC API, it's fair simple:</p>
<p> </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/ed84ed8467c8e0813eca.js"></script>

<p><em><strong>!important: </strong>These Strings "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simplecrud", "root", "sa" depends on the configuration of the database that you created, the first one is the URI of the database, the second "root" is the user of that database, and the last "sa" is the password of that database</em></p>

<p>So, what happens when we use this class? Every time we call its method "getConnection" it returns a Connection with the database, that will be useful to create Statements, execute SQL Queries and plenty <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html">more</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Creating the PersonDAO</h3>
<p>The PersonDAO will be the class that will manipulate the class Person and communicate with the database, sending persons to database, updating persons, retrieving persons from the DB, which means, the CRUD main methods</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/4177708c2bf222920845.js"></script>

<p> </p>
<h3>Creating the Controller</h3>

<p>This is the most confusing part. All because of the confusion of <strong>not</strong> using JSP file to process the request, so what we will use? <strong>Servlets! </strong> A Servlet fits better in the Controller role, because they won't show anything to the user, it will only get the request data, verify which action the user is trying to make, do something and redirect the user to another page. If you're using JSP files as controllers, probably you're <a href="http://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/37537">doing it wrong</a>. So, basically, our PersonController will take the user request, see if the user is trying to edit, insert, update, remove or retrieve... and do the right thing, pay extremely attention to this code</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/1f86192880faa70760a7.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the View: Index.jsp</h3>

<p>The index will be pretty simple and straight forward, it will just call our controller, passing the action by the get method, in this case, the ListPerson, the Controller will see that the action required is the ListPerson so it will do what it has to do, get all users from the database and list'em.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/bb8cc63c5efb47f59c74.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the View: ListPerson.jsp</h3>

<p>The controller got the action coming from the index and tried to retrieve every person in the database and put all person objects in the session, if there is any Person in the DB, of course. Here is the code to do it, as you can see we’re already using the JSP tags to not use pure Java Scriplets  </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/bcb0acccceeb8a652b8f.js"></script>

<h3>Creating the View: Person.jsp</h3>
<p>This will be the page that the user will be able to insert or edit a Person in the database so it can be loaded on the ListUser.jsp. As the Controller says, if the request has an ID, the Person.jsp will be loaded with a Person, otherwise, it won't. (<em>expecting that the user fill the form to add a new Person to the database</em>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.universocomputacao.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/smallcrudscreen2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74 size-medium" src="http://www.universocomputacao.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/smallcrudscreen2-300x263.png" alt="smallcrudscreen2" width="300" height="263" /></a></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/digorithm/c312976f8ddb79d71051.js"></script>

<h3>Last details and conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, at the first sight this implementation can be a little confusing, mainly because of the flow logic and the controller built with Servlet, understanding the flow means understanding it as a whole. Make sure you understand the MVC logic and the concepts behind JSP, Servlets and JDBC.</p>

<p>If you're trying to copy the whole code, make sure you import the right libs, including the JSTL, responsible for a few tags I've used in this code. Also i used the Twitter's Bootstrap to help me with the frontend UI.</p>

<p>You can download the code here on my <a href="https://github.com/digorithm/SmallCRUD">GitHub</a></p>

<p>If there's something wrong with your implementation, please let me know, drop me an email or post a comment here and I'll make sure it will work properly! :]</p>

  </h2>

    2014
  </div>


  <div>
    
    <h3 id="what-are-the-main-goals-of-the-object-oriented-programming">What are the main goals of the object-oriented programming?</h3>

<p><em>1. Abstraction, yes, i had to put this in the first place, in my point of view, this is the biggest goal of the OO programming</em></p>

<p>2. Encapsulation, which is a form of abstraction!</p>

<p>3. Reusability</p>

<p>4. Modularity</p>

<p>5. Readability</p>

<p>Let’s say that OO programming did <strong>never</strong> exist, so, i can say that any procedural programmer <em>(C, fortran, cobol, etc..)</em> who has a little notion about how to build organized codes, would, naturally, evolve to an organization that would look like the actual concept of OO programming.</p>

<p>Don’t you think? It would be intuitive, the object-oriented thinking is a quite natural way to think, let me show you… We are used to separate <em>things</em> (from now we’ll call thing as objects) by it’s <em>class</em>, just like the class “Car”, we know GM, wolksvagem, nissan, honda…but they all are cars, right? And we’re also used to say that something <em>inherited</em> some particularities from his precedent… And that’s the idea behind the OO programming, grab the main concept of object and class that defines objects in <strong>real world</strong> and use it on programming!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/dog.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just before the creation of Object-Oriented Programming, the system development in C was using the concept of breaking the big problem into small sub-problems, where each sub-result together would generate the solution of the big problem in question. It’s actually smart to think like this, the OOP languages just formalized this concept (and of course, create others features, but this was the start point). Look at this following problem: We want a data structure to represent the functionaries of determined business, this functionary should have a name, age, salary and a function to change his salary. Let’s deal with it in the smartest way, which is, creating separately some structure that will represent the functionaries, in C we would code something like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct functionary{
  int age;
  char name[50];
  float salary;
}stru_func, *ap_func;

void riseSalary(ap_func pthis){ 
      int n;
      printf("Enter new salary: \n");
      scanf("%d", n);
      pthis-&gt;salary = n;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, in this func.c, we have the structure to represent the functionaries and the function that we will use. (from now, we’ll call function as METHODS)</p>

<p>And here’s the <strong>main code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include "func.c"
int main(){
  stru_func new;
  printf("Enter the age, name and salary: \n");
  scanf("%d", &amp;new.age);
  scanf("%s", &amp;new.name);
  scanf("%f", &amp;new.salary);
  printf ("%d \n", new.age);
  printf ("%s \n", new.name);
  printf ("%f \n", new.salary);
  riseSalary(&amp;new);
  printf("%f", new.salary);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Done, now we have a nice example of class and object…but, made with C! Where the class is this struct called “functionary” and the variables inside it we call “attributes” and the function “riseSalary” we call “method” (obs: look that the function/method is OUTSIDE the struct functionary), in fact we separate the module that represent the functionaries from the main module, and if we want, we can use this functionary module in other problems that need a struct to represent functionaries with those attributes/methods!</p>

<p>And…where’s the object? Right there in the main module, where we created a “variable” called “new” from the struct functionary, this is called “INSTANCE”, in this moment, we create a object from its class! Again, the class is the structure that represent the functionary and the object is the “variable” that we created with this structure!</p>

<p>All these concepts already happened before the creation of the pure Object-Oriented languages, but there was a need of formalize these techniques, creating more rigorous, useful and trustful standards.</p>

<p>The same problem that we solved in C, in java, would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class functionary
{
  public int age;
  public string name;
  public int salary;
  public void riseSalary(int n)
  {
      this.salary = n;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you should have noticed, the method now is INSIDE the structure that represent the functionary (the class). And what the big advantage of this? the class is now more portable, we can reuse it easily!</p>

<p>in the main module we could just create as many object as we want just using: <em>“functionary func = new functionary();”</em></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Of course that the big evolution of procedural to Object-Oriented did not stop there! The concept of reuse, organize and divide the code and the problem created others many famous techniques that we can use on classes and objects, like the <strong>polymorfism</strong>, inheritance, abstract class and many others! But this evolution kept one main goal: <strong>modularity with more abstraction.</strong></p>

  <div>
    
    <p>Well, it all will start with your first steps on studying programming, a very innocent and and naive programming, i mean, your very first “Hello World” and the classics “Read 3 inputs and print the sum of them”, where your concerns will happen because of some missing commas, whitespaces and some misplaced IF’s… things that at first sight may cause a little confusion, you’ll start to think that’s even something hard.</p>

<pre><code>#include
int main(){
printf("Hello World");
return (0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The time will pass, you’ll start to understand logic better, and get impressed with your first program written with 150 lines of pure java code, and this will be you amazed about it</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/amazed.png" alt="images" /></p>

<h3 id="now-youve-become-a-programmer-or-even-better-a-software-engineer-right-we-shall-answer-that-soon-lets-continue-our-timeline"><strong>Now you’ve become a programmer, or even better, a <em>software engineer</em>, right?! we shall answer that soon, let’s continue our timeline…</strong></h3>

<p>You’ll commit yourself to do your first not-so-trivial software project, maybe a stock management system, using some sort of web technology and data persistence with some cool database system. After a few days and some effort, you’ll finish your project and get even more amazed…1500 lines of code!!</p>

<p>Until happen the first problem with your system and you gotta fix it, and you will have to come back to it after 1 month without looking at its code and your first reaction, probably, will be this:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/scared.jpeg" alt="images" /></p>

<p>And you start to suspect <em>“Well…maybe i’m not this Software Engineer thing yet”</em></p>

<p>From this point, you start to study some software development principles, design patterns and how to write reusable and maintainable code and all this stuff. Uff…finally, now you’ll think <em>“i feel more professional now”</em> and that finally you can deal with the industrial world, so you’ll come to a important step:</p>

<h3 id="its-time-to-get-a-software-engineering-internship"><strong>“it’s time to get a software engineering internship”</strong></h3>

<p>Well, I will tell you the consequences from this important decision in 3 phases:</p>

<h3 id="phase-1new-technologies-to-study">Phase 1 — New technologies to study</h3>

<p>After a short search for a internship opportunity, a software company finally will hire you as an intern, and you, with all your experience dealing with code bases that you created by yourself <em>(getting the mark of even 2 thousand lines of code, wow!)</em> will <em>think</em> that you’re prepared… So your manager says some new stuff to study, so you can understand the technologies of the company: J2EE, JPA, Hibernate, JSF, HTTP, FTP, JavaScript, Jquery, AJAX among others, well, you’ll be a little shocked at first, that’s normal, but anyway, you, <strong>strong programmer</strong>, affirms <em>“it’s okay, i can learn it quickly”</em></p>

<p>what bring us to the big shock that is the phase 2…</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-the-company-show-to-you-their-legacy-systems">Phase 2— The company show to you their legacy systems</h3>

<p>Ok, then you studied every concept that were indicated to you to learn on <strong>phase 1</strong>, so, you, with all experience that you have <em>(because you wrote 2 thousand lines of code, right?)</em>, affirms <em>“ I’m ready to work with the company’s systems ”</em>, then, your manager shows to you their system that was written in java, <strong><em>10 years ago, with a total of 700 thousand lines of code without documentation</em></strong> and he says:</p>

<p><em>— “You will be responsible by the maintenance of this system, here’s the code, study it, good luck!”</em></p>

<p>And you, <em>programmer</em>, looks to the code, runs the system, looks to the code again…and your <em>only</em> reaction is:</p>

<p>And this is the time that you’ll start to doubt about the universe’s laws. You’ll start to think that nothing makes sense anymore and all your knowledge was a lie…after all…</p>

<p><em>“seriously, what the fuck is this? there’s no way to understand this code, it’s giant, messy, old and nothing makes sense” </em>— you think.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/matrix.gif" alt="This is what the code looks like to you" /></p>

<p>And then, the desperation takes over your thoughts, you realize that everything you learnt on your classes and on <em>codecademy</em> was very different of the real world systems, you don’t know where to start…but after read the code 10000000 times…you, in a <strong>magic</strong> way, gets to the <strong>phase 3</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="phase-3-the-discovery">Phase 3— The discovery</h3>

<p>After much effort and lost nights, you, magically, starts to see patterns in these many lines of code, you start to see a logical flow and the most important thing:</p>

<h3 id="you-start-to-realize-that-even-a-uncommented-code-has-the-power-to-tell-you-a-story">You start to realize that even a uncommented code has the power to tell you a story</h3>

<p><em>“A story? how is that possible?”</em></p>

<p>Exactly, the more time you spent there trying to understand the code, more you started to see <strong>patterns</strong>, it’s like the code could talk by itself, telling what problems they were trying to solve, it’s like you were present at that time when the old engineers were doing a <em>brainstorm</em> to find the solution to certain problem</p>

<p>And you, young future engineer, start to see the logical flow inside those 700 thousand lines of code, and strange as it may sound, you start to mentally talk with the code, and the most amazing, the code starts to answer to you, and it gives you tips and paths to follow so you can understand it better.</p>

<p>And suddenly you reached a state of mental ecstasy, so all your powers got back to your hands and all this messy and dirty code starts to make sense and gain shape:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/matrix2.jpeg" alt="images" /></p>

<p>And then, the following quote from <em>Eric Filson</em> makes a huge sense in your life:</p>

<h3 id="the-art-of-programming-is-finding-patterns-where-others-see-only-chaos"><em>“The art of programming is finding patterns where others see only chaos”</em></h3>

<p>Yes, this is where you really start your love story with the art of software writing, is where you create your extreme connection between your mind and the code, is where you, temporarily, disconnect from the real world and connect yourself to new others universes: <strong>Your systems</strong>.</p>

<p>Where new laws are created and you understand all of them, yes, all of them. Universes which you have total control and you like it. At this moment is created an emotional bond between you and the system, you created it, you own your own universe, use it with responsability, after all, thousand people depend on it.</p>

<p><strong>No matter what happen, don’t give up to understand the logical flow of your new universe, the key to this comprehension is to stay mentally connected to the system, feel it, live it, walk inside it just like the processor, step by step, line by line, command by command, trust me</strong></p>
