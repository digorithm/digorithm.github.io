        <p>The more I think about the advantages and disadvantages of upfront design, the more I find it a really complex subject, I mean, the whole Software architecture diagramming in general. I’ve been following the development of the <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2014/08/24/c4_model_poster.html">C4 model</a> for a considerable time, I find it interesting, but it still brings me the old struggles about how much detail we should put into the diagrams and whether we should do it while planning the Software, while developing it, or after <em>(by doing reverse engineering)</em>…. or even more extreme, doing these 3 options, developing the architecture diagrams and evolving them over time.</p>

<p>I think that, when drawing architecture diagrams, we should focus on getting the right purpose and the right level of abstraction. Two of the most important purposes to me, when designing a diagram, is:</p>

        <p>Artificial Neurons is one of the most beautiful ways to simulate a biological behavior through computation, despite the fact that it’s not very close to the level of details of a real neuron. But it captured the core of what a neuron is doing.</p>

<p>And I find that trying to understand this mathematical method by first understanding the concept through a metaphor <em>(which, in this case, I think that the metaphor is our mathematical side, and not the biological one, the biological is just, you know, the real thing)</em> is really valuable to gain an intuition on this topic.</p>

        <p>Well, this case was a fun one, sentiment analysis is a sub type of NLP <em>(natural language processing)</em> in which you have to train a model to analyze a text, and classify it was a negative sentiment or a positive sentiment. In this case, I wanted to apply it on movies reviews, to see if a review is a negative one or a positive one. So, basically, teaching this kind of sentiment to the machine.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of challenges in doing this kind of NLP, experience has told me that when the text is big, it is usually hard to predict things about it… and most of the times, movie reviews are big chunk of text.</p>

        <p>One of the most commons tasks in Machine Learning is text classification, which is simply teaching your machine how to read and interpret a text and predict what kind of text it is.</p>

<p>The purpose of this essay is to talk about a simple and generic enough Architecture to a supervised learning text classification. The interesting point of this Architecture is that you can use it as a basic/initial model for many classifications tasks.</p>

        <p><strong>Redis is such a great technology.</strong> Unfortunately, there’s still people who don’t know Redis or don’t know that Redis can be used as a Cache System to improve the speed of responses.</p>

<h3 id="why-redis">Why Redis</h3>

<p>Well, let’s start this discussion remembering how a common Relational Database basically works: Suppose we’re using a MySQL, every time your app sends a request to the MySQL client, the MySQL client gotta make a trip to the hard drive to get the data asked in the request, this can become a problem if the data asked in request is big… and if there are many requests at the same time, this can generate a huge latency, annoying users or worse.</p>

<p>Today a lot is said about APIs. Everything has an API, every programmer (newbie to expert) uses tons of API. Also, today we can see a lot of people talking about microservices and the idea of total separation of backend, frontend, web services or <em>whatever</em>. So we can <em>(and we do)</em> hear a lot about REST/RESTful APIs. We have 3 current problems with it:</p>

        <p>I’ve been working with AI/Machine Learning at <a href="http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/">Jusbrasil</a> recently, and it’s being pretty challenging due to the <em>huge</em> amount of data that we have to deal with, so cleaning this data and making predictions and classifications in an acceptable time demands a nice AI architecture.</p>

<p>That said I can say that I’m extremely thankful for a few technologies that are helping me go through this challenge <em>(and the pain of cleaning this amount of data)</em>: Python, Scikit Learn, Pandas, and the whole stack that the Scikit Learn use, such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and few others.</p>

<p>Then, how can we make the machine predicts things based on that learned data? Those are the question answered by one of the most classic Machine Learning Algorithms, the <strong>Gradient Descent Algorithm</strong>, from a Mathematical-Statistical side it’s called <strong>Univariate Linear Regression</strong>.</p>

<p>This is one of the tools of the Machine Learning toolbox, and what it tries to do is to model a relationship between a scalar dependent variable Y and a explanatory variable X.</p>

<h3 id="in-laymans-term">In Layman’s term…</h3>

<p>Let’s suppose you have a few points distributed in a Graph, so you already know that in a point A you have a well defined X and Y, which means, if you input X, your output will be Y, and in a point B you have a well defined X’ and Y’ as well. But, thing is, if a point emerge between A and B, and you only have the X… what will be the Y <em>(the output)</em>?</p>

        <p>I’ve been reading many texts on automata theory these times, and let me tell you, that’s such a wonderful thing. It pretty much explain how computers can…. compute! Simply put, Automata Theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as Automata.</p>

<p>From the mathematical models to represent it to the fun programming implementations, it’s really great and exciting to study it!</p>

        <p>Graph Theory is definitely one of my favorite branches of the Mathematics &amp; Computer Science, mostly because of its nearest infinity applications, in both real world problems and pure theoretical problems.</p>

<p>These days I’ve been working (with my buddy Daniel Almeida) in a framework to create and manipulate graphs. Which means, creating a data structure to represent graphs, edges, vertexes and creating algorithms to work on this structure. All this is being made with Java and I’ll expose this code here, as I saw a terrible lack of good readable codes about it on the internet.</p>

        <p>One of the most common kind of applications in today's tech/business world is the CRUD system, that is the idea of the user interacting with a database, so the user can Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete <em>(yep, that awful name came from this)</em> data from this database. Also, <strong>learning how to create a CRUD with a language is a great way to understand the basics of this language, the basics of software design, engineering and architecture.</strong> In layman's term, a CRUD page is just a page where you can insert a thing, edit that thing, search that thing and delete that thing, just that!</p>

        <p>###What are the main goals of the object-oriented programming?###</p>

<p><em>1. Abstraction, yes, i had to put this in the first place, in my point of view, this is the biggest goal of the OO programming</em></p>

<p>2. Encapsulation, which is a form of abstraction!</p>

<p>3. Reusability</p>

<p>4. Modularity</p>

<p>5. Readability</p>

        <p>Well, it all starts with your first attempt to write a program; a very innocent and and naive program - I mean, your very first “Hello World” and the classic“Read 3 inputs and print the sum of them”. Your only concerns will be  some missing commas, whitespaces and some misplaced IF’s - things that  may cause a little confusion first. You’ll eve think that it is hard.</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include
</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello World"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then time will pass, you’ll understand the logic better and get impressed with your first program; 150 lines of pure java code, and you will be amazed by it</p>
