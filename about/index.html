<p>Hey, guys! I'm a <b style="font-family:'gothambold';">Computer Science</b> Student, <img src="../images/me.gif" width="200" height="200" align="right" style="padding-top:5px;" /> I'm the current President of the Academic Directory of Computer Science at Salvador University (A Brazilian university), I'm extremely interested in <i>Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Security</i>. Since I was young I have a passion for mathematics and technology, so i, undoubtely, took this path and never looked back <i>(still happy about it, by the way)</i>.</p>

    <p>I created some community activities for digital inclusion, I write on a few blogs about Mathematics, Computer Science and Software Development, I'm motivated by the <b style="font-family:'gothambold';">distribution of the scientific and technological knowledge.</b></p>

    <p>At the University, I'm a Teacher Assistant of a few classes such as Discrete Mathematics, Software Development and Algorithms, as i constantly advocate that <b style="font-family:'gothambold';">the only way to really learn something is to teach it</b>.</p>

    <p>Actually I'm working as a researcher with the <a href="http://www.tdresearchteam.com/?page_id=11" target="_blank">TDRT</a> in a project of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Federal University of Bahia, University of Salvador, SENAI-CIMATEC and the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering.</p>

    <p>As a Hobby, i really enjoy functional programming paradigm using Haskell, Knowledge Based Systems using OWL (Ontology Web Language), Algorithm Complexity Analysis and ways to improve its performance, a branch of the Artificial Intelligence known as Machine Learning, where I implement it using Java or Python, among others topics in Computer Science and its branches.</p>

    <p>
      If you have any cool idea and need someone to work with you or just wanna talk about it, feel free to
      email me at <b style="font-family:'gothambold';">contatodigo@hotmail.com</b>.
