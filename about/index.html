<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Hey, guys! I'm a BSc in <em>Computer Science</em> , I'm the current President of the Computer Science Students' Union at my University, I'm extremely interested in <i>Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Security</i>. Since I was young I have a passion for Mathematics and Technology, so I, undoubtely, took this path and never looked back <i>(still happy about it, by the way)</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Currently I'm a Engineer at <a href="http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/" target="_blank">JusBrasil</a>, working with Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning.
</p>
<p>
    Also I'm working as a Researcher with the <a href="http://www.tdresearchteam.com/?page_id=11" target="_blank">TDRT</a> in a few projects of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Federal University of Bahia, University of Salvador, SENAI-CIMATEC and the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering.

<h3>Why I write on this blog</h3>

<p>I constantly advocate that <strong>the only way to really learn something is to teach it.</strong> That's why I used to be a Teacher Assistant in a few classes, such as Discrete Mathematics, Programming and Algorithms, but due to the lack of time, I'm not teaching for now (I'll be back soon, I hope), that's why I try to maintain this blog, so I can keep passing forward some knowledge, helping someone or at least, learn more about a topic.</p>

&nbsp;

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>
Currently my main work/research field is <strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong> and <strong><em>Machine Learning</em></strong>, but I'm also interested in:

<p>1. <em><strong>Distributed Systems and scalability</strong></em>, why and how to scale big systems? I'm an eternal curious about the CAP Theorem, Byzantine Generals' Problem, Fault Tolerant Systems and more.</p>

<p>2. <em><strong>Software Architecture</strong></em>, again, why and how to scale big systems? But how to do that keeping in mind the DevOps process, maintainability, performance and elegance? When to use Microservices, when to NOT use this strategy? Start with a Monolith and them, break it into Microservices? Or start thinking about the separation of Concerns/Domains from beginning?</p>

<p>3. <em><strong>Security</strong></em>, I'm a curious about the best practices of Hacking and Systems Security, even more when it's about Internet of Things.</p>
</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>
    My passion about the Computer Science <em>(and Science, in general)</em> goes way beyond my main interests, you can always find me:

    <p>
        1. Spending some free time cracking code challenges, such as the ones you can find at SPOJ, TopCoder, HackerRank, Programming Pearls, and more. So, if you want to talk about it or just sit and solve a puzzle or two with me, you're always welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Reading and thinking about <em>Theoretical Computer Science</em>, I don't pass a good and deep talk about it, the limits of computation is something that really intrigues me. 
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Learning more about the many Programming Languages out there. I try to keep myself unattached to specific Technologies, but I do have preferences, such as Python, C and the realm of Functional Programming <em>(I have a thing for Haskell and Scala)</em>
