## Overview

Hey, guys! I'm a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer, I'm extremely interested in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Security. Since I was young I have a passion for Mathematics and Technology, so I undoubtedly took this path and never looked back *(still happy about it, by the way)*.

Currently I'm a Graduate Student at University of British Columbia, working on my Masters in Computer Science and working as a Research Software Engineer at [SPL](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/software-practices-lab).

Before that I was working with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at [Jusbrasil](www.jusbrasil.com.br)

You can find further details of my work on my [resume](/content/rodrigo_araujo.pdf).


## Why I write on this blog

I constantly advocate that the only way to really learn something is to teach it. That's why I used to be a Teacher Assistant in a few classes, such as Discrete Mathematics, Programming and Algorithms. That's why I try to maintain this blog, so I can spread some knowledge and also solidify my own knowledge.

## Interests

Currently my main work/research field is Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Software Engineering, but I'm also interested in:

1. Distributed Systems and Scalability

2. Security


## Hobbies

My passion about the Computer Science (and Science, in general) goes way beyond my main interests, you can always find me:

1. Spending some free time cracking code challenges, such as the ones you can find at SPOJ, TopCoder, HackerRank, Programming Pearls, and more. So, if you want to talk about it or just sit and solve a puzzle or two with me, you're always welcome.

2. Reading and thinking about Theoretical Computer Science, I don't pass a good and deep talk about it, the limits of computation is something that really intrigues me.

3. Learning more about the many Programming Languages out there. I try to keep myself unattached to specific Technologies, but I do have preferences, such as Python, C and the realm of Functional Programming (I have a thing for Haskell, Scala and Clojure)
