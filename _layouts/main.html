<h1>Brief introduction</h1>

<p>Hey there, my name is <strong>Rodrigo Ara√∫jo</strong>. I live in Vancouver, Canada, though originally from Brazil<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I've had many titles: Software engineer, computer scientist, programmer, developer, hacker<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>, musician<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>. But I believe we shouldn't describe ourselves in terms of labels<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> but rather in terms of values, beliefs and actions. Therefore, here is what I do: <strong>I build software and do research in order to help humans achieve higher and greater things.</strong></p>

<p>I'm currently a graduate student at the University of British Columbia under the Computer Science department. I work as a research software engineer at <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/software-practices-lab">SPL</a> and as a teaching assistant helping over thousand students to build better software.</p> 

<p>Previously I worked as a machine learning engineer at the lovely and great <a href="https://www.jusbrasil.com.br">Jusbrasil</a>, one of the biggest law and government websites in the world.</p>

<h1>Research and work</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">Software</a> <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">is</a> <a href="">eating</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/04/11/why-software-is-eating-the-world/#31314bde29a2">the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/software-is-eating-the-world-5-years-later/">world</a></em> and it's amazing how unreliable and internally broken most software and software practices are. This is mostly due the fact that we are a young field taking its first baby steps, and this is quite exciting. I believe it is our job, as a community, to slowly but steadily improve the way we build software. Thus, one of my personal missions is to <strong>make software more reliable and correct; by both improving software and improving how we build software.</strong></p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Currently I'm working on the intersection of artificial intelligence, software engineering and distributed systems, pursuing ways to <strong>build better self-adaptive systems that can change, heal, and optimize in real time in order to make engineers more productive and systems more reliable.</strong></p>

<p>I also have interests in:</p>

<p>
<ul style="color: black;">
    <li>Distributed Systems and Infrastructure Reliability</li>
    <li>Software Engineering</li>
    <li>Software Design and Architecture</li>
    <li>Software Analysis, Testing, and Verification</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and how to build better systems using their techniques</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1> Why I blog and disclaimers </h1>

<p>I write blog posts and essays here for the following reasons:</p>

<p>

<ul style="color: black;">
    <li>To solidify my knowledge on the discussed topic, as if it was more like of an act of reflection;</li>
    <li>To help others trying to understand something that I've written about</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>However, here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<p>
<ul style="color: black;">
    <li>All opinions and views are my own;</li>
    <li>It's very likely that I am painfully wrong on a post that you've read, so:</li>
    <ul style="color: black;">
        <li>Don't blindly believe everything I write, question everything <em>(and let me know those questions sometime!)</em></li>
        <li>Let me know where I made a mistake, it's a win-win game: you teach me something and you learn more about something!</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>
